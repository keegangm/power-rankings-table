Chances to make playoffs: >99.9%
Projected wins: 56.0, When we last saw them: After years of coming close, the Celtics finally claimed banner No. 18 with a dominant run through the playoffs, capped by a five-game defeat of the Dallas Mavericks. The 2023 offseason acquisitions of Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis transformed Boston into a juggernaut that won a league-leading 64 games with a 16-3 mark in the playoffs. Boston's summer was spent keeping the team intact. Extensions were given to Jayson Tatum, Derrick White and Sam Hauser, after Holiday got his own in April. The biggest news of Boston's offseason was the Grousbeck family putting its controlling stake in the team up for sale. The decision has left the short-term future of the team -- set to cost more than $500 million in combined payroll and luxury taxes for the 2025-26 season -- up in the air., Biggest strength and weakness: Boston has plenty of strengths, but its 3-point shooting is near the top of the list. The Celtics averaged more than 50 attempts per game in their opening preseason games in Abu Dhabi, and it won't be a shock to see them set the NBA record for makes and attempts this season. There aren't many obvious weaknesses, but center health stands out. Al Horford is in his age-38 season and Porzingis is already out until at least December because of offseason surgery. The Celtics probably will need both players to repeat as champs. -- Tim Bontemps , Celtics in NBA Rank:

The Celtics outscored opponents by 10.7 points per game last season -- the fifth-best differential in NBA history. They also went 6-0 in clutch-time games with a plus-46.9 net efficiency -- the first team to do so in a single postseason since play-by-play was first tracked in 1997.]"

Chances to make playoffs: 97.3%
Projected wins: 51.2, When we last saw them: The Thunder's ""breakfast"" season -- borrowing from general manager Sam Presti's analogy to indicate how early the organization was in the building process -- ended up being a breakout campaign. After a three-year playoff hiatus, Oklahoma City became the youngest No. 1 seed in NBA history and advanced to the Western Conference semifinals, giving the Thunder reason to believe the foundation of a long-term contender is already in place with MVP runner-up Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the last two Rookie of the Year runners-up, Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren. OKC also added two high-caliber role players in Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein -- without dipping into OKC's stockpile of first-round draft capital -- during the offseason to enhance the West's most well-rounded roster., Biggest strength and weakness: It's hard to find a weakness on this roster. Presti addressed the Thunder's glaring flaw (28th last season in rebounding rate) by adding Hartenstein. The former Knick will sit out at least the first month of the season, but reigning Coach of the Year Mark Daigneault will soon have the option of playing two skilled 7-footers together in a jumbo-sized lineup that assures OKC will almost always have a rim-protector on the court. Presti flipped the one starter who was a questionable fit, guard Josh Giddey, for an elite glue guy with championship experience in Caruso. The Thunder joined the Celtics as the only teams to rank among the top five in offensive and defensive ratings last season, and Oklahoma City could be even better on both ends of the court. -- Tim MacMahon, Thunder in NBA Rank:

Chances to make playoffs: 64.6%
Projected wins: 40.6, When we last saw them: Even without star forward Julius Randle and center Mitchell Robinson, who'd been ruled out due to surgical procedures, the Knicks were on the cusp of reaching the Eastern Conference finals as they hosted the Pacers at Madison Square Garden in Game 7. But then the wheels came off in just about every conceivable way, with OG Anunoby -- who tried to come back from a hamstring strain prematurely -- hobbling around from the start, and star guard Jalen Brunson fracturing his shooting hand later in the game. By that point, the snakebit New York club lacked the horses to close out Indiana -- let alone take on the eventual champion Celtics in the next round., Biggest strength and weakness: The club's offense, which at times was bogged down last season when teams sought to wall off Brunson, should be supercharged this season with the high-profile addition of Karl-Anthony Towns. The duo of Brunson and Towns will be difficult to stop: Is it more important to sink down and seal off Brunson's ability to get to the basket, or is the priority to stay with Towns if and when he stays on the perimeter? Regardless, the Knicks will now have better floor spacing. New York's depth undoubtedly took a hit with the loss of Randle and Donte DiVincenzo in a trade to Minnesota for Towns. Randle was a two-time All-NBA selection and was one of the toughest players on a team, and DiVincenzo -- on one of the league's best contracts -- hit the third-most 3-pointers in the NBA in 2023-24. Because of the bruising style the Knicks play under coach Tom Thibodeau, depth always matters; particularly on the wings. Speaking of wings, the Knicks might have the best defensive duo in Anunoby and Mikal Bridges. But there's still a question of rim protection with Towns, who primarily played power forward in Minnesota. This will be a shift for the big man, especially with Robinson, the backup center, unavailable for the first few months. -- Chris Herring, Knicks in NBA Rank:

Karl-Anthony Towns (30)
Mikal Bridges (38)
OG Anunoby (51)
Josh Hart (61)

Over the past three seasons, Bridges has given up a 42.9% field goal percentage as the contesting defender, fifth lowest among 50 players to have contested at least 2,500 shots. Alongside Bridges on the wing will be Anunoby. The Knicks went 20-3 in Anunoby's 23 games compared with 30-29 in his absence (from injury or pre-trade).]"

Chances to make playoffs: 81.6%
Projected wins: 46.3, When we last saw them: The Nuggets, after winning the 2023 NBA title, were bounced in the second round on their home court in a Game 7 loss to the Timberwolves. Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray & Co. looked physically and mentally spent after trying to defend their title but now look to get back to the top of the West. They'll do it without key cog Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who left in free agency for Orlando, although Denver added Russell Westbrook to give them a much-needed spark and leadership off the bench., Biggest strength and weakness: The Nuggets will once again rely heavily on the best player in the game (and recently voted as the No. 1 player in ESPN's top 100) in reigning MVP Jokic, who ranked in the top five in total points, rebounds and assists last season. He might have to shoulder even more during the start of the season after coach Michael Malone said Murray felt something ""funny"" in his knee ahead of last week's preseason game against Phoenix. The Nuggets' title hopes will be determined by Murray's health as well as their bench after Christian Braun moved up into the starting lineup. As such, Westbrook, Peyton Watson, Julian Strawther and Dario Saric will have to do one of the tougher things in basketball -- deliver positive minutes when Jokic is resting. -- Ohm Youngmisuk, Nuggets in NBA Rank:

Chances to make playoffs: 99.6%
Projected wins: 51.5, When we last saw them: The 76ers lost a hard-fought six-game series to the Knicks in the first round of the playoffs. Each team completed wild comebacks inside Madison Square Garden, with New York ultimately ending Philadelphia's season on its home court. Former MVP Joel Embiid never quite looked like himself after sitting out most of the final 2½ months of the season because of a knee injury and returned just before the playoffs., In response to their postseason performance, Philadelphia landed Paul George in free agency -- one of the biggest offseason trades via free agency since Kawhi Leonard joined George with the Clippers five years earlier. They also re-signed Tyrese Maxey, extended Embiid, signed Andre Drummond, Eric Gordon and Caleb Martin and also brought back Kelly Oubre Jr. and Kyle Lowry. They also have several first-round picks they can use in deals to improve this season., Biggest strength and weakness: Star power. When healthy, the trio of Embiid, George and Maxey is just as good as any team entering this season. If Philadelphia is going to break its decades-long championship drought, it'll be on the backs of those stars delivering in April, May and June. Conversely, this team's weakness is the health record of Embiid and George who are both currently dealing with injuries that stifled them in the preseason. The future of the franchise depends on the chemistry these two superstars cultivate this season -- they just need to be on the court to do so. -- Bontemps, 76ers in NBA Rank:

Chances to make playoffs: 96.3%
Projected wins: 50.3, When we last saw them: The Mavericks morphed into contenders after the trade deadline last season, when GM Nico Harrison continued the aggressive roster reconstruction around the star duo of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving by acquiring two athletic role players (forward P.J. Washington and center Daniel Gafford). Dallas, which had the league's stingiest defense for the final quarter of the regular season, rolled all the way to the NBA Finals before the supporting cast's spotty 3-point shooting prevented the Mavs from mounting much of an upset bid against the Celtics. Harrison addressed that void by winning a free agency recruiting battle for Klay Thompson, one of the most dangerous catch-and-shoot threats in NBA history., Biggest strength and weakness: The Mavs have all the ingredients to be an elite offensive team. They feature the league's most potent pair of playmakers in Doncic and Irving, and they've surrounded them with players with gravitational pull, such as Thompson as a 3-point shooter and the center tandem of Dereck Lively II and Gafford as lob-finishing vertical spacers. Coach Jason Kidd said they'll figure out during the ""journey"" of the season how to maximize the fit of all the pieces -- specifically meshing Thompson's constant off-ball movement with Doncic's preferred style that is heavy on pick-and-roll and isolations. The big question is whether the Mavericks' defense can be tough enough to return to the Finals. Plugging Thompson, 34, into the spot that was formerly occupied by free agency departee Derrick Jones Jr. leaves the Mavs without a primary perimeter defender in the starting lineup. ""I want to get rid of that notion that I'm not the same defender as I once was,"" Thompson said. ""I truly believe I am, and I'm excited to prove people wrong, that I can still guard the elite players in this league."" -- MacMahon, Mavericks in NBA Rank:

Chances to make playoffs: 82.8%
Projected wins: 46.5, When we last saw them: The Wolves are coming off one of the most successful seasons in franchise history, making an appearance in the Western Conference finals for just the second time. And to build off that 56-win season, Minnesota made a franchise-altering trade before the start of training camp by trading four-time All-Star big man Karl-Anthony Towns to the Knicks for forward Julius Randle, guard Donte DiVincenzo and a future first-round pick. It's a move the Wolves hope gives them a deeper team surrounding guard Anthony Edwards as he continues to develop into a star., Biggest strength and weakness: The Wolves were the No. 1 defensive team in the NBA by a comfortable margin last season, which figures to be their strength again with four-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert in the middle along with Edwards and Jaden McDaniels on the wings. Yet, Edwards has stated multiple times he believes the Wolves need their crunch-time offense to improve at the end of games, which begins with his decision-making and growth as the team's go-to option. -- Jamal Collier, Timberwolves in NBA Rank:

Chances to make playoffs: 55.5%
Projected wins: 42.7, When we last saw them: The Suns were swept out of the first round by the Timberwolves , losing the four games by a combined 60 points. The team's big three of Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, and Kevin Durant fell flat after entering the season with the third-best championship odds. But the team started off 4-6 and failed to find consistency thanks in large part to Beal missing 29 games and a lack of depth to mask his absence. Frank Vogel paid the cost for failing to reach expectations, fired after one season as coach. Mike Budenholzer, a championship coach thanks to his Milwaukee Bucks beating the Suns in 2021, is now tasked with making the pieces fit., Biggest strength and weakness: The Suns were fifth in the league in team 3-point percentage (38.2%) and scored 11.3% of their points on midrange shots, the second most in the league. With Durant, Booker and Beal, the Suns are an elite jump shooting team. However, their offensive diet also exposed a weakness last season.

An injury near the end of the regular season to Giannis Antetokounmpo prevented the Bucks from playing in a postseason game with both him and Damian Lillard. This offseason they added a few key reserves -- Gary Trent, Taurean Prince, Delon Wright -- to round out their depth but are hoping some continuity with their two stars and coach Doc Rivers will help the team reach its championship potential., Biggest strength and weakness: Experience will be a double-edged sword for the Bucks this season. On one hand, they still have the core of a championship team and Antetokounmpo and Lillard as their leaders with proven playoff experience -- if they can stay healthy. But the perils of fielding a veteran roster mean the Bucks will have to manage the health of most of their key players -- four of their projected starters will be at least 30 years old this season. -- Collier, Bucks in NBA Rank:

Projected wins: 47.5, When we last saw them: For the first time in 30 years, a Cavs team without LeBron James on the roster made it past the first round of the playoffs. After advancing past the Magic in seven games -- with Donovan Mitchell exploding for 50 points in Game 6 -- they lost to the eventual-champion Celtics in five games with Mitchell (calf) and Caris LeVert (knee) missing the end of the second-round series. It was an eventful offseason, with the team replacing coach J.B. Bickerstaff with Kenny Atkinson and Mitchell agreeing to a three-year, $150.3 million contract extension that will keep him in Cleveland through the 2028-29 season., Biggest strength and weakness: Cleveland was eighth in the league in assists per game with 28.0 a night thanks to the playmaking ability of Mitchell, LeVert, Darius Garland and Max Strus. The crisp passing led to quality looks, too, with the Cavs ranking 12th in team field goal percentage at 47.9%. However, they were in the bottom half of the league in turnovers with 13.7 per game, a big part of why they were only 24th in field goal attempts per game (87.2).

Chances to make playoffs: 69.3%
Projected wins: 44.4, When we last saw them: Murphy's Law wreaked havoc on the Grizzlies last season. Everything that could go wrong in Memphis pretty much did, starting with Ja Morant's season-opening 25-game suspension and the continuous barrage of medical issues, including Morant's season-ending shoulder injury. Coming off of three straight playoff appearances, including two 50-plus-win seasons, the Grizzlies limped to a 27-55 finish and a spot in the lottery. At No. 9, they drafted big man Zach Edey, who figures to have a major role in Memphis as a rookie., Biggest strength and weakness: The homegrown trio of Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Desmond Bane has proved that the three are good enough to get home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. Memphis has made major renovations to the supporting cast since its last playoff berth in 2023, bringing in Marcus Smart and Edey to fill the roles formerly occupied by Dillon Brooks and Steven Adams.

Projected wins: 41.1, When we last saw them: Indiana had a charmed season last year, breaking through to the conference finals for the first time in a decade after also reaching the championship game of the NBA's inaugural in-season tournament. The Pacers responded by locking in their core, inking in-season acquisition Pascal Siakam to a massive new contract, re-signing Obi Toppin, and extending the contracts of T.J. McConnell and Andrew Nembhard., Biggest strength and weakness: The Pacers' obvious strength is their blistering offense, thanks to All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton. If Haliburton can get over the lower leg injuries that have hampered him throughout 2024, expect Indiana to once again have one of the league's best offenses. Conversely, the Pacers are going to have to make improvements on defense to match last year's achievements, and it's hard to see who will come through there.

Chances to make playoffs: 46.9%
Projected wins: 38.7, When we last saw them: The Magic had a breakout season on their way to making the playoffs for the first time in three years. Despite losing in seven games to the Cavaliers, it was a major step for a young team built on defense under coach Jamahl Mosley. The team re-signed several core players (Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze, Moritz Wagner and Jonathan Isaac) but its biggest move was extending Franz Wagner to a five-year, $224 million max extension. That solidifies Orlando's frontcourt with All-Star big man Paolo Banchero -- who is primed to take another leap in his game., Biggest strength and weakness: Orlando is the only team since 1999 that has recorded 45 or more wins with its top three scorers being 22 years old or younger -- Banchero, Wagner and guard Jalen Suggs. But the Magic need to do better at taking care of the basketball. They ranked 24th in the league in turnovers last season with 14.7 per game, which led to 16.4 opponent points per game.

Chances to make playoffs: 47.0%
Projected wins: 41.8, When we last saw them: The  Warriors are coming off of one of their longest offseasons in recent history after being eliminated by the Kings in the first round of the play-in tournament. Since then, the Warriors have lost one of their cornerstones in Klay Thompson and a veteran in Chris Paul. But they brought in Buddy Hield, De'Anthony Melton and Kyle Anderson, and they expect big leaps and increased work from fourth-year player Jonathan Kuminga and sophomores Brandin Podziemski and Trayce Jackson-Davis. Throughout camp, Golden State has boasted about its depth and feeling as if it has the players to start climbing back up in the West., Biggest strength and weakness: If their preseason numbers mean anything, the Warriors should be one of the top 3-point shooting teams in the league. Through the preseason, they averaged a 38.2% 3-point percentage. Whether this level of shooting is sustainable in the regular season is up for debate, but Golden State will continue to emphasize shooting and a fast-paced offense. The Warriors are looking to work on their defense -- particularly in transition. Last season, Golden State allowed the sixth-most points in transition per game, and the 1.17 points per possession the Warriors allowed in transition was the third most in the NBA. The Warriors were in the 17th percentile of transition defense and overall had the 15th-ranked defense in the NBA.

Projected wins: 42.7, When we last saw them: For a second straight season, the Lakers were eliminated by the Nuggets in the postseason. Although the series went five games -- a meager improvement from the sweep in 2023 -- it came in the first round rather than the conference finals. With the team's core roster cemented and trade options scarce, L.A. pulled the lever that franchises so often do when stuck in similar predicaments: It fired its coach, Darvin Ham. ""You can't buy a house that's not for sale,"" said Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka. First-year coach JJ Redick replaced him, and the Lakers are banking on the idea that a coaching adjustment, combined with a little more luck in the health department, can be enough to turn the team back into a contender around LeBron James and Anthony Davis., Biggest strength and weakness: On offense, the Lakers have a potent starting five. James, Davis, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and D'Angelo Russell played 389 minutes together last season and had a 116.0 offensive efficiency, according to ESPN Research. That ranked 10th among 21 five-man lineups to play 300-plus minutes together last season. However, that same group allowed 1.36 points per possession in transition -- which was 19th among 20 five-man lineups to defend 100-plus transition possessions.

Projected wins: 42.5, When we last saw them: New Orleans' first playoff appearance since 2022 ended swiftly in a four-game sweep by the Thunder with Zion Williamson out with an injury after playing a career-high 70 games during the regular season. The team addressed a glaring weakness in the offseason by trading for point guard Dejounte Murray, a strong two-way performer who will provide vocal leadership but also, most importantly, a playmaker and facilitator to improve New Orleans' execution down the stretch of close games. The trade depleted some depth, but the Pels now have three former All-Stars on the roster in Murray, Williamson and Brandon Ingram., Biggest strength and weakness: Murray was an off-ball guard with Atlanta, but he'll return to the role of traditional point guard with added emphasis on defense. It bodes well for a player who made the 2018 All-Defensive team and led the league in steals in 2022. The Pelicans' starting five already features a first-team All-Defensive player in Herbert Jones and another promising 3-and-D wing in Trey Murphy III. The center position will be a major problem area this season for the Pels. At 6-7, Jones shouldn't be playing center.

Chances to make playoffs: 54.1%
Projected wins: 42.5, When we last saw them: One year after making the playoffs for the first time in 16 years, the Kings got bounced in the second round of the play-in. After that loss, Sacramento knew it needed to make some changes, so the team brought in DeMar DeRozan and sent Harrison Barnes to San Antonio and Chris Duarte to Chicago. This was the first big move the Kings have made since bringing in Mike Brown as head coach. While they don't think they took steps back last season, they know they have to regain the momentum they had in 2023 in a highly competitive Western Conference., Biggest strength and weakness: The Kings are primed to have a high-powered offense. DeRozan gives the team another player who can score 25 points a night and perform in the clutch, while taking some pressure off of De'Aaron Fox. Putting DeRozan next to Domantas Sabonis will allow them to continue to use dribble handoffs, deploy pick-and-rolls and score in transition -- several big parts of their offense the past two seasons, which they hope will help integrate DeRozan. One weakness Sacramento is facing is its lack of size. The Kings have struggled against longer and bigger teams, and they didn't address that over the offseason. If they plan to play players such as DeRozan or Kevin Huerter at small forward, they will have to rely even more heavily on their offense to just outscore their opponent. -- Andrews, Kings in NBA Rank:

With Jimmy Butler sidelined with a sprained right MCL he suffered in the play-in tournament and trade deadline acquisition Terry Rozier out with neck spasms, Miami lost to the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in five games. The Heat looked into trading for Utah Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen, but the former All-Star wound up extending his contract to stay in Salt Lake City. So, one of the most stable franchises in the league is heading into the season with a nearly identical roster -- veteran guard Alec Burks was Miami's most notable addition -- and is banking on improved health, along with another strong campaign from gold medalist and All-Star center Bam Adebayo, to creep back into contention., Biggest strength and weakness: Anchored by a perennial Defensive Player of the Year candidate in Adebayo, the Heat posted the fifth-best defensive efficiency in the league last season, allowing only 111.5 points per 100 possessions. But while they made the opposition grind it out, their offense was so inept it made the other team's defense look just as effective.

Over that span, Jalen Green caught fire, averaging 27.7 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.9 assists. The Rockets finished 41-41, a 19-win improvement from the previous season, which represented the largest increase in wins by any team from 2022-23 to 2023-24. Houston stood relatively pat in the offseason but used its No. 3 pick on sharpshooting Reed Sheppard, who can seriously contend for Rookie of the Year., Biggest strength and weakness: Houston's collection of young talent could set up the Rockets to contend for a while if players such as Green, Alperen Sengun, Jabari Smith Jr., Amen Thompson and Tari Eason continue to develop. The club pieced together a nice blend of up-and-coming players and solid veterans to take the lead in establishing the new culture under Udoka, which starts with a strong defense that ranked ninth last season.

Paul George and James Harden combined to go 2-for-16 from 3 while Kawhi Leonard watched from the bench with inflammation in his knee. It would be George's final game as a Clipper, signaling the franchise's pivot from contending for a title now to trying to remain competitive until it can land another younger star in the future. The Clippers re-signed Harden but did go younger, targeting scrappy defensive-minded players such as Derrick Jones Jr. in free agency. And now with Leonard sidelined indefinitely this season as he rehabilitates inflammation in his knee, the Clippers' postseason hopes remain fuzzy., Biggest strength and weakness: The Clippers' defense will be a strength and keep them competitive in games. Besides acquiring defenders such as Jones, Nic Batum and Kris Dunn in free agency, their biggest addition this offseason was defensive coordinator Jeff Van Gundy. On the other side of the ball, with George gone and Leonard sidelined indefinitely, Harden will be asked to shoulder much of the offensive load, especially on the playmaking side in setting up teammates such as Ivica Zubac.

This summer, San Antonio added leadership, and the legitimate starter-level point guard Wembanyama needed by signing future Hall of Famer Chris Paul, in addition to bringing in veteran and former champion Harrison Barnes. The Spurs drafted Paul's eventual successor, Stephon Castle, with the No. 4 pick in June's draft., Biggest strength and weakness: Wembanyama provides elite rim protection, finishing with 254 blocks, which ranked as the most in a season since 2015-16 (Hassan Whiteside). Wembanyama erases mistakes and allows San Antonio's perimeter defenders to take chances. Still, collective improvement on defense has been a point of emphasis for the Spurs throughout training camp and the preseason. The team also needs to find more consistent outside shooting.

Projected wins: 36.9, When we last saw them: The play-in round had been kind to Atlanta in 2022 and 2023, with the Hawks advancing from that stage to reach the playoffs each time. But the third time was anything but a charm last season. The Hawks faltered defensively -- as was the case often for last season's 27th-ranked defense -- by allowing Coby White to drop 42 points and the Bulls to put up a whopping 131 points to end Atlanta's season, and force the sub-.500 Hawks back to the drawing board, including trading guard Dejounte Murray to the Pelicans in late June., Biggest strength and weakness: With Murray gone, All-Star guard Trae Young can go back to running the show on his own, which comes more naturally for the 26-year-old floor general. He never evolved into someone who moved all that well off the ball, so allowing Young to do more of what he does best -- returning to a usage rate closer to 35% -- is a safer bet in some ways and could lift the offense., With Jalen Johnson back healthy, and players such as Dyson Daniels and Larry Nance Jr. in the fold, Atlanta should take a much-needed step forward defensively this year. But even if players such as No. 1 pick Zaccharie Risacher help on that end -- the 6-9 forward French forward should, given his length and wingspan -- the Hawks are still likely to finish in the bottom half of the league on defense, if not in the bottom 10 once again. -- Chris Herring, Hawks in NBA Rank:

They acquired Josh Giddey from Oklahoma City to lead their offense and pair with Coby White and Patrick Williams as part of a young core, although Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic and Lonzo Ball still remain as holdovers., Biggest strength and weakness: Chicago has started each of the past three seasons saying it plans to play fast, but it might finally have the personnel to start doing so. Giddey should help ignite the Bulls' fast-break offense, and they envision him creating passing advantages for his teammates similar to what Ball did in his first year in Chicago.

The third-year forward was one of two players -- along with Giannis Antetokounmpo -- to average at least 19 points, 8 rebounds, 6 assists, a steal and a block last season, and he made his first All-Star team as a result. Arriving in the midseason trade that sent Anunoby to the Knicks, Immanuel Quickley was given a five-year, $175 million deal. Toronto also grabbed a pair of intriguing prospects in the draft in Ja'Kobe Walter and Jonathan Mogbo. Most importantly, though, the Raptors committed a five-year max extension to Barnes, officially making him the face of the next generation of the franchise., Biggest strength and weakness: The Raptors are in the middle of a rebuild, but as a result have a lot of young, athletic players at the disposal of coach Darko Rajakovic and should be able to push the tempo as a result. They'll also likely need to do so, as this team is not exactly equipped to fire away from beyond the arc with a lot of success.

Chances to make playoffs: 33.8%
Projected wins: 37.0, When we last saw them: Charlotte walked off the floor victorious in its final game last season; even if the win did come under odd, tanktastic circumstances. (The Cavs, apparently seeking to draw Orlando in the first round as opposed to the Sixers or Heat, sat their best players and even played three centers simultaneously in the closing stages of the game.) It was a relatively meaningless game for the Hornets, though, which was the problem: Charlotte, a franchise snakebitten for years, hasn't won enough to make the end of the season matter., Biggest strength and weakness: Win or lose, Charlotte figures to get a look at second-year wing Brandon Miller's progression. From February through April last season, he averaged nearly 20 points, 5 rebounds and 2.5 assists on 45% shooting and 37% from deep -- potentially the makings of a franchise player., Injuries haven't helped Charlotte escape the league's basement. LaMelo Ball's health seems like a constant question. Center Mark Williams', too. The Hornets have ranked among the league's top 10 in salary paid to injured players in each of the past two seasons, according to Spotrac. Adding to the uncertainty in Charlotte are new coach Charles Lee and new executive vice president of basketball operations Jeff Peterson. There aren't immediate expectations to win in place, but the club needs a good enough run of health to make a proper evaluation. -- Herring, Hornets in NBA Rank:

Chances to make playoffs: 2.7%
Projected wins: 33.1, When we last saw them: For the second straight season, the Jazz were competitive through 50 games and took a turn south after unloading veterans at the trade deadline. The anticipation is that the 2024-25 campaign will take the route of a traditional rebuilding season in Salt Lake City. Utah made a massive commitment to Lauri Markkanen as a building block, signing the 27-year-old forward to a maximum extension worth $238 million over five years -- making him ineligible to be traded this season. He's an exception on a roster that has undergone a youth movement, featuring seven players 23 or younger who are rotation candidates., Biggest strength and weakness: Jazz fans are likely to spend the season frequently checking the lottery standings in hopes of landing an early pick in a loaded draft class. Meanwhile, there are two major questions to monitor: Which veterans could be valuable as trade offerings as the deadline nears? And which young players will provide reasons to believe they can be part of the Jazz's core as the rebuilding project pays dividends down the road? -- MacMahon, Jazz in NBA Rank:
Lauri Markkanen (33), Number to watch: Perimeter protection and turnovers.
The Jazz ranked last in defensive efficiency last season while also allowing a 39.5% 3-point field goal percentage from opponents -- the worst by any team in a season since the 2010-11 Cavaliers. The Jazz ranked last in turnover percentage and 29th in points per game allowed off turnovers. That led to Utah defending 18.2 transition possessions per game last season, the most by any team in a season since player tracking began in 2013-14.]"

Chances to make playoffs: 2.1%
Projected wins: 29.3, When we last saw them: Last season the Pistons set an NBA record with 28 consecutive losses en route to finishing with the worst record in the league for a second straight season. In an effort to incite change, the Pistons fired team president Troy Weaver and coach Monty Williams in the offseason. They then named Trajan Langdon as president of basketball operations and hired J.B. Bickerstaff as head coach. In an effort to add more shooting, Detroit also signed forward Tobias Harris to play alongside Cade Cunningham., Biggest strength and weakness: The Pistons' frontcourt should see an improvement with Harris joining Isaiah Stewart, Jalen Duren and Paul Reed -- an effective rotation no matter who's on the court. The biggest question for Detroit will be around how its combination of young players plays alongside that core as well as whether the team can get some improved shooting from Jaden Ivey, Ausar Thompson and its latest lottery pick, Ron Holland. The Pistons were last in the NBA last season in made 3-pointers. -- Collier, Pistons in NBA Rank:
Cade Cunningham (67), Number to watch: 3-point efficiency.

Chances to make playoffs: 12.6%
Projected wins: 33.5, When we last saw them: Brooklyn's season mercifully ended on the final night of the regular season with a 21-point loss in Philadelphia, which then led a summer defined by a series of moves to rebuild for the future. Even then, the team was already in a state of flux, with interim coach Kevin Ollie having replaced Jacque Vaughn to close out the campaign. In July, the Nets traded Mikal Bridges to the Knicks for five future first-round draft picks, as well as getting back their 2025 and 2026 first-round picks from Houston., Biggest strength and weakness: With their 2025 and 2026 first-round picks back in their control, there will be some sort of light at the end of the tunnel. That includes being in the mix for next year's No. 1 pick for what will be a strong draft class, headlined by Duke freshman Cooper Flagg. As for how things will go on the court, the team will lack identity for a while as it enters a transitional season with an expiring Ben Simmons contract and a new coach in Jordi Fernandez. Perhaps that was to be expected. After all, it didn't have much of one last season. -- Herring, Nets in NBA Rank:
None, Number to watch: Cam Thomas' continued improvement.
Thomas increased his scoring average by 11.9 points per game from 2022-23 to 2023-24, the largest increase in the NBA among players to play 50-plus games in each season.

Chances to make playoffs: 2.7%
Projected wins: 33.1, When we last saw them: The Trail Blazers dropped 15 of their last 17 games in the first season without Damian Lillard as a rash of injuries wiped out the availability of several key players at different times. Robert Williams III sat out 76 games; Malcolm Brogdon missed 43; and Jerami Grant and Deandre Ayton combined for a total of 55 scratches. Scoot Henderson struggled with his rookie transition into the league, a process likely made tougher by backcourt mates Anfernee Simons and Shaedon Sharpe missing a combined 86 contests. In all, 18 players started at least one game last season for Portland., Biggest strength and weakness: The Blazers boast young, intriguing talent in Henderson, Sharpe, Simons and new addition Deni Avdija, along with tremendous depth at center in Ayton, Williams, Duop Reath and lottery pick Donovan Clingan. Portland could wind up trading one of the veteran bigs later in the season to one of a handful of teams around the league looking for a center. Portland's youth is a strength in its ongoing rebuild, but it's also a weakness due to inexperience. Injuries are already creeping in again, too, as Sharpe will be sidelined at the start of the season due to a left labral tear. -- Wright, Trail Blazers in NBA Rank:
Jerami Grant (80)
Anfernee Simons (100), Number to watch: Henderson's rim protection.
Henderson averaged 18.9 points and 7.9 assists in his final 14 games of the season while also shooting 40% on 3-pointers during this stretch.

Chances to make playoffs: <0.1%
Projected wins: 22.4, When we last saw them: The Wizards ended on a six-game losing streak to round out a dismal season. Washington's 15-67 regular season record, however, helped it land the second overall pick in the NBA draft lottery, and it used that pick to draft French 7-footer Alex Sarr. But the Wizards are still a very long way from Michael Winger's and Will Dawkins' vision. Washington did trade Deni Avdija in a deal that landed rookie Bub Carrington, the 14th overall pick in this year's draft; Malcolm Brogdon; a 2029 first-round pick; and two future second-round picks. The Wizards also traded up a couple of spots to No. 24 to draft Kyshawn George and signed Jonas Valanciunas to bolster the front line., Biggest strength and weakness: While most eyes will be on No. 2 pick Sarr, the Wizards are high on the potential of last year's seventh overall pick, Bilal Coulibaly. The 20-year-old guard was ahead of schedule last season, averaging 8.4 points and 4.1 rebounds while also showing potential on defense. But while Coulibaly and other prospects such as Carrington should have plenty of runway this season to develop, that likely means another long season in Washington. By the trade deadline, the Wizards could be garnering interest from other teams in vets such as Kyle Kuzma, Valanciunas, Corey Kispert and Brogdon (currently out after thumb surgery). -- Youngmisuk, Wizards in NBA Rank:
Jonas Valanciunas (91), Number to watch: Jordan Poole at point guard.
With Tyus Jones now with the Suns and Brogdon hurt, Poole will likely get more runs at point guard. According to Second Spectrum, the Wizards averaged 1.08 points per possession when Poole brought the ball up the floor last season. That ranked second worst among 70 players to bring the ball up for 1,000-plus possessions.]"

Adding Tyus Jones and Monte Morris should help solve the point guard issue, while Mason Plumlee is a solid backup big who can help with playmaking. Plus, Mike Budenholzer has a better offensive track record than Frank Vogel. Look, this team has yet to prove it can sustain greatness for any significant period of time, but you simply can't ignore the theoretical glory with a trio that talented."
CBS_241002_NOP,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,New Orleans Pelicans,10,"The Pelicans made a big move this offseason, and it somehow didn't include First Team All-Trade Machine forward Brandon Ingram. Instead they brought in Dejounte Murray for picks and role players, giving them a slightly truer point guard than CJ McCollum -- though he's also someone else who needs the ball in his hands, which means less time in Zion Williamson's. And while Jonas Valanciunas wasn't the best fit, New Orleans now appears to have no starting center on the roster? Seems like there's another move to be made, but for now the Pelicans are an intriguing, if not a bit clunky, contender in the West."
CBS_241002_CLE,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Cleveland Cavaliers,11,"The numbers suggested that the Cavs needed to eliminate some redundancy this offseason by breaking up the Donovan Mitchell-Darius Garland or Jarrett Allen-Evan Mobley pairings. That hasn't happened yet (Mitchell, Allen and Mobley were all extended), so Cleveland will return a largely unchanged roster that was close to securing the East's No. 2 seed last season. New coach Kenny Atkinson will look to improve an offense that went from eighth in 2022-23 to 16th last season."
CBS_241002_MEM,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Memphis Grizzlies,12,"Don't be surprised if last season ends up being a fever dream hallucination, and the Grizzlies are right back in the West playoff picture this season. Ja Morant's absence allowed Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr. to each take impressive leaps, while role players like Santi Aldama, Vince Williams Jr. and GG Jackson gained invaluable reps in big minutes. Zach Edey will step right in as a rebounder and screen setter, and if Marcus Smart stays healthy they'll get all the defense they missed from Dillon Brooks last season. Stock up, Memphis."
CBS_241002_ORL,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Orlando Magic,13,"The Magic made about as perfect an addition as they could hope for by bringing in Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, a knock-down 3-point shooter who won't disrupt Orlando's rugged defensive tenacity. If Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner can make another leap this season to help improve their 22nd-ranked offense, the Magic could be in the mix at the top of the Eastern Conference."
CBS_241002_IND,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Indiana Pacers,14,"One of last season's best stories enters the year with new expectations after re-signing Pascal Siakam to be Tyrese Haliburton's running mate. It's hard to consider them in the East's elite given their atrocious defensive rating last season, so that will be Rick Carlisle's primary area of improvement in training camp. Given how well this team can score, however, they might end up in the top five even if they finish 24th in defense again."
CBS_241002_SAC,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Sacramento Kings,15,"The Kings wanted to get De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis some help, so they took a big swing on DeMar DeRozan, who fits in theory but generally needs the ball in his hands to do damage (his usage rate was significantly higher than Sabonis' last season). DeRozan could also hurt their defense, which made legitimate strides last year but still landed in the middle of the pack. It's going to be interesting to see how the fit works, but it's understandable to be skeptical that bringing in DeRozan suddenly makes the Kings contenders in the West."
CBS_241002_GSW,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Golden State Warriors,16,"It still feels weird thinking of Klay Thompson in a different jersey, but the Warriors made some solid moves to fill in for him, bringing along Buddy Hield, Kyle Anderson and De'Anthony Melton. Chris Paul's departure means Golden State lacks a true backup point guard behind Steph Curry, but Anderson, Draymond Green and Brandin Podziemski are all high-IQ playmakers who can help piece it together. GM Mike Dunleavy Jr. said this roster could lead to ""a wide range of outcomes,"" and he couldn't be more spot on. They're deep, but one of the problems last year was that Golden State lacked a go-to starting and closing unit, and it seems like that will still be an issue."
CBS_241002_LAL,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Los Angeles Lakers,17,"Finishing 15th in offense and 17th in defense last season, the Lakers were about as mediocre as you can get. They made no significant changes this offseason (OK bringing in Bronny James was significant, but he likely won't contribute much this year), so it's hard to see how LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Co. can suddenly vault into title contention as currently constructed. That means another move is likely on the way (D'Angelo Russell trade rumors? WHAAAAT!), but to start the season the Lakers are looking like a .500 team in the West."
CBS_241002_MIA,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Miami Heat,18,"It's nearly impossible to imagine the Heat ever being BAD, but this roster doesn't exactly instill confidence. If Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro are all on the court, they should be able to compete no matter the opponent -- but that only happened 27 times last season. We all know Erik Spoelstra will work his magic and get this team to the playoffs, but it's fair to ask whether Miami's days of being a scary postseason opponent are in the past."
CBS_241002_LAC,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Los Angeles Clippers,19,"This certainly isn't the way Steve Ballmer wanted to open the first season of the Clippers having their own arena in 25 years. Paul George left them high and dry for greener pastures in Philly, while Kawhi Leonard reportedly underwent offseason knee surgery -- and who knows what that means for his eventual (possible?) return. So a team with three stars is now potentially down to one in James Harden, who is certainly no stranger to carrying an entire offense by himself. Entering the season, however, you simply cannot view the Clippers as a legitimate title contender, and even getting to the playoffs may prove challenging given Leonard's injury history and the depth of the West."
CBS_241002_HOU,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Houston Rockets,20,"The Rockets finally added some shooting by drafting Reed Sheppard, and he'll work spacing wonders for a team that finished 20th in offense last season. The story from last season, of course, was Ime Udoka's defense, which jumped into the top 10 from 29th the year before -- simply remarkable stuff -- largely due to the addition of Fred VanVleet and Dillon Brooks. Houston is a sexy pick to contend this season, and that will all depend on the continued progression of Alperen Sengun and Jalen Green."
CBS_241002_SAS,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,San Antonio Spurs,21,"The Spurs are hard to predict this season because Victor Wembanyama could legitimately become a top-five player over the next few months. If that happens, they're a trade away from becoming extremely interesting, even in the rugged Western Conference. Chris Paul is the perfect mentor for a young team, while No. 4 overall pick Stephon Castle should add a perimeter stopper to a defense that was 12th in the NBA last season after the All-Star break. San Antonio might have the widest range of outcomes of any team in the league, but we'll all be watching regardless to see what Wemby does next."
CBS_241002_ATL,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Atlanta Hawks,22,"Atlanta decided the Trae Young-Dejounte Murray thing wasn't working, so they sent Murray to New Orleans for a couple of role players and draft capital. The team is clearly skewing younger after drafting relatively raw talent Zaccharie Risacher No. 1 overall, but how will Young feel about that direction? It's hard to see the Hawks competing for a playoff spot, and you'll certainly hear Young's name in trade rumors throughout the season, particularly if the losses come early and often."
CBS_241002_CHI,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Chicago Bulls,23,"The Bulls are slowly starting to pick a direction, saying goodbye to DeMar DeRozan, Alex Caruso and Andre Drummond while welcoming in 21-year-old Josh Giddey and 19-year-old rookie Matas Buzelis. They still have Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic, for now, so that should keep them in the Play-In Tournament hunt as long as they're healthy and on the roster."
CBS_241002_UTA,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Utah Jazz,24,"The Jazz have still yet to fully embrace a direction, but extending Lauri Markkanen means that trade chatter will be hushed for at least this season. In theory they should be better than last year, but players like Jordan Clarkson and Collin Sexton could be sent packing if Danny Ainge decides he's had enough winning and wants to stock up on lottery balls. This team is going to need to score a ton of points with a defense that finished 30th in the NBA last season."
CBS_241002_DET,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Detroit Pistons,25,"For the first time in a while, there's reason for optimism in Detroit this season. Cade Cunningham finally has at least a couple of shooters around him with the addition of Malik Beasley and Tim Hardaway Jr. (even Tobias Harris has shot near 40% in the past), and the talent of Jalen Duren, Ausar Thompson and Jaden Ivey is undeniable. We'll see if J.B. Bickerstaff can put it all together, but the pieces are there to compete for a play-in spot after years of bottom-dwelling."
CBS_241002_TOR,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Toronto Raptors,26,"The Raptors aren't going to be good this season, but if RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley play like they did after coming to Toronto last season and Scottie Barnes builds off a tremendous third year, the future is bright. Outside of those three, there's no telling who will be part of the future, but Gradey Dick and Ja'Kobe Walter are intriguing prospects."
CBS_241002_POR,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Portland Trail Blazers,27,"Portland has a lot of talented young pieces -- it's just a matter of getting them all on the court at the same time. Listen, they're not going to be good, but a starting lineup of Scoot Henderson, Anfernee Simons, Shaedon Sharpe, Jerami Grant and Deandre Ayton should at least be competitive from night to night. Rookie Donovan Clingan won't need much of a learning curve, and if Robert Williams III can give them anything, Chauncey Billups will be able to present some matchup nightmares with his lineup options."
CBS_241002_BRK,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,241002,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,Brooklyn Nets,28,"It was pretty clear from last season that Mikal Bridges didn't have ""No. 1 option"" stuff -- not yet anyway -- so landing FIVE first-round picks was an incredible return for one of the league's most coveted role players. Keep that in mind as you watch the Nets lose a lot of games this season while try to figure out which players (Nic Claxton? Cam Thomas?) are in the long-term plans and which are just fodder for the next trade."

Let's keep it at 15 or fewer, all right people? After a horrific start, Jordan Poole was actually decent to finish last season, averaging 21 points and six assists on 44/37/91 splits in his final 27 games. So he and Kyle Kuzma, plus the addition of Jonas Valanciunas, will make sure Washington has ""bucket-getters"" on the court at all times. The defense is going to be really bad again, but maybe No. 2 overall pick Alex Sarr can solve some of those issues -- probably not this season, though."

They clearly need a full season from LaMelo Ball to have any shot at being competitive, and it's not great that Mark Williams is injured already... again. The good news is, Brandon Miller looked like the absolute real deal last season and should only get better. That being said, the ceiling for this team is so low that a toddler would have to crouch.

The Wiz are getting hammered most nights but perhaps Poole, who was a disaster in the first half of the season, is starting to turn a corner."

OffRtg: 129.0 (1) DefRtg: 113.1 (15) NetRtg: +16.0 (4) Pace: 97.3 (28)
The Celtics picked up right where they left off, celebrating banner No. 18 by destroying the Knicks on opening night.
Three takeaways

They were ridiculously hot as they tied the NBA record for 3-pointers on Tuesday, but the Celtics were mostly taking good shots that were the results of attacking weaker defenders and making the right reads. This is what they do.


Last season, the Celtics led 18 games by at least 30 points, with that tying the 2016-17 Warriors for the most games led by 30-plus in the 28 seasons for which we have play-by-play data. And they began this season by leading both of their first two games by at least 30 points, also building a 23-point lead in Detroit on Saturday. They’ve scored a ridiculous 118 points on 76 possessions (155.3 per 100) in the first quarter.


They blew that 23-point lead in Detroit, but have now (and going back to the end of last regular season) won their last eight games that were within five points in the last five minutes, having allowed just 51 points on 63 clutch defensive possessions (81 per 100) over that stretch. The highlight on Saturday was Derrick White helping off the corner and blocking Cade Cunningham’s dunk attempt for the tie with 51 seconds left.

A year ago, the Celtics’ first November game was a 51-point win over the Pacers, who they’d eventually meet in the (more competitive) conference finals. Their first November game this year is in Indiana, where they lost twice last season.

The Thunder have kept pace with the champs, becoming just the 11th team in NBA history to win each of its first three games by at least 15 points.
Three takeaways

The Thunder won their first two games by a total of 34 points despite shooting just 16-for-76 (21%) from 3-point range. They made as many 3-pointers against the Hawks on Sunday (16-for-40) as they made in the first two games combined.


The 3-point shooting didn’t matter because the Thunder were so dominant defensively. Their wins in Denver and Utah were two of the three times in Week 1 where a team held its opponent below 90 points per 100 possessions. Chet Holmgren’s rim protection has been rather ridiculous. He’s blocked 12 shots in the three games and opponents have shot just 15-for-34 (44.1%) at the rim when he’s been there.


On the other side of the floor, Holmgren is just 3-for-15 from 3-point range. But he’s driving more and making more plays off the dribble and on the move. He’s got seven turnovers with his nine assists, but the added aggressiveness should benefit the Thunder down the line.

Only one team in NBA history — the 1971-72, 69-13 Lakers — has won its first four games by at least 15 points. The Thunder can be the second on Wednesday when we get our first Holmgren-Wembanyama matchup of the season. The two young bigs combined to shoot just 7-for-25 (28%) in their first meeting last November, but were then a combined 33-for-60 (55%) over the next two games, with Victor Wembanyama missing the final meeting of the season.

OffRtg: 120.1 (4) DefRtg: 114.6 (20) NetRtg: +5.6 (6) Pace: 100.8 (15)
The Lakers clearly had the most impressive Week 1, beating the Wolves, Suns and Kings (with a rest disadvantage). It’s their first 3-0 start in 14 years.
Three takeaways

Their total margin of victory was just 18 points, but only one of the three wins (vs. Sacramento) was within five points in the last five minutes. And the Lakers already have as many wins in games they trailed by 20 points (1-0 after coming back from 22 down against the Suns) as they did last season (1-17).


Last season, the Lakers averaged 3.5 fewer shooting opportunities than their opponents, the league’s worst discrepancy. In Week 1, they totaled 15 more shooting opportunities than their opponents, with a big jump in offensive rebounding percentage being a key factor.


Anthony Davis has been huge, averaging 34 points, 11 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 2.3 blocks over the three games, with 48 of his 56 shots having come in the paint. But the Lakers have also outscored their opponents by 35 points in his 31 minutes on the bench.

Having played their first three games at home, the Lakers now head out on a five-game trip that begins with tough games in Phoenix and Cleveland. LeBron James is 19-3 all-time (9-2 on the road) against the Cavs.

OffRtg: 125.5 (2) DefRtg: 105.2 (4) NetRtg: +20.3 (2) Pace: 102.2 (12)
The Cavs had a soft schedule in Week 1, but they took care of business and became the first team since the 2017-18 Clippers with three double-digit wins in its first three games of the season. (The Thunder joined them one night later.)
Three takeaways

The 125.5 points per 100 possessions that the Cavs’ offense has scored is better than any three-game stretch that they had after the All-Star break last season. Their effective field goal percentage of 63.2% is best in the league by a wide margin. Caris LeVert (87.5%) and Jarrett Allen (83.3%) rank first and second among 160 players with at least 20 field goal attempts.


They continue to heavily stagger the minutes of their four best players, with the four having played just 38 total minutes together over the three games. Darius Garland and Allen have played 33 minutes together without Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley, while Mitchell and Mobley have played 43 minutes without Garland and Allen. In those 76 total minutes with just one starting guard and one starting big on the floor, the Cavs are a plus-52, having scored 132.3 points per 100 possessions. (LeVert’s ridiculous shooting has obviously been a factor in those numbers.)


Their opponents have shot just 56-for-120 (46.7%) in the paint, and in their first two games, the Cavs outscored the Raptors and Pistons by a total of 40 points (86-46) in the restricted area.

The competition gets tougher this week, and no team held the Cavs to fewer points per 100 possessions last season than the Knicks, who won two of the three meetings.

The Celtics were on fire as they tied the NBA record for made 3-pointers on Tuesday, but they were getting good looks from beyond the arc, often by putting Karl-Anthony Towns in pick-and-roll. Things were bad once Towns ventured out of the paint in blitz or at-the-level coverage, but he mostly stayed in drop coverage against the Pacers on Friday (when one blitz led to a layup).


Mikal Bridges had a rough start, shooting 0-for-5 (including 0-for-4 from 3-point range) in the first half in Boston on Tuesday. Since then, he’s 15-for-20 (4-for-6 from 3). He was creating his own buckets and went 7-for-10 on pull-up 2-pointers.


Though the different results were almost entirely about the defensive end of the floor, the Knicks did retain almost 30% of available offensive rebounds on Friday. Three nights earlier, they retained just 18.4%, what would have been their second-lowest rate last season (95 total games, including playoffs). Towns improves their initial offense, but it will be interesting to track how much of their rebounding advantage they’ve lost.

The Knicks’ early-season tests continue with a visit from the Cavs on Monday. They’ve won nine of their last 11 games against Cleveland, including a 4-1, first-round series in 2023 in which they dominated the glass.

The Wolves had a disappointing start to the season, losing in L.A. on Tuesday. But they only have to look back a year, when they lost the opener in Toronto, to know that the first game doesn’t mean much. They followed up the defeat with wins over Sacramento and the Raptors.
Three takeaways

The opener was, essentially, lost with a 27-6 Lakers’ run in the second quarter in which the Wolves’ defense — in zone, in man-to-man and especially in transition — was not good. A year ago, they held their opponent under a point per possession in six of their first seven games.


The Wolves have had two of their three frontline players — Julius Randle, Rudy Gobert and Naz Reid — on the floor for all 144 minutes. As expected the defense has been at its best when Gobert has been one of the two, though the offense has been potent — 90 points on 73 possessions (123.3 per 100) — in 35 minutes with Randle and Reid together.


The Anthony Edwards-Randle pick-and-roll should be a pretty popular action down the stretch of close games, with one option out of it being Randle isolating against guards (Nowitzki-style) from the nail or elbow after a switch.

The first Western Conference finals rematch is a rest-advantage game for the Wolves on Tuesday. They were 12-3 (7-1 at home) in rest-advantage games last season.

A 2-1 start isn’t bad considering the strength of the Suns’ schedule, and they were at a rest disadvantage when they beat the Mavs on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Last season, the Suns were the league’s worst fourth-quarter team by a huge margin and 1-22 in games they trailed by double-digits in the fourth. On opening night against the Clippers, they were down 10 with less than six minutes left. But they came back and won in overtime, scoring 22 points on their final 13 possessions of regulation and holding the Clips to just 10 on 11 in the extra period.


They mostly played small down the stretch, with a center (Jusuf Nurkić) on the floor for just 3.7 of the 8.3 clutch minutes. Minutes with Kevin Durant at the five were pretty bad defensively last season.


The Suns got two games with their star trio together before Bradley Beal missed the win over Dallas with elbow soreness. Beal had shot 7-for-12 from 3-point range over the first two games, but the Suns allowed 122 points per 100 possessions in 38 total minutes with all three stars on the floor.

Beal is listed as questionable for the Suns’ game against the Lakers on Monday. The Suns will have rest advantages against the Clippers on Thursday (their second Intuit Dome game in the first nine days of the season) and against the Blazers two nights later.

The Mavs were 11-2 last season when Luka Dončić scored at least 40 points. This season, they’re 0-1, because he didn’t get enough help in Phoenix on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Dončić had just 12 assists over the Mavs’ first two games, with seven of them going to Klay Thompson, who, after a rough preseason, shot 11-for-22 from 3-point range. But the Mavs scored just 98 points on 91 possessions (107.7 per 100 – worse than the league average) in 41 total minutes with Dončić, Thompson and Kyrie Irving on the floor together.


Daniel Gafford continues to start at center, but Dereck Lively II has been playing more minutes, and the 20-year old tied a career high with six assists in the Mavs’ win over the Spurs on Thursday. Most of them were simple pass-backs to Dončić, but he also had a nice high-post feed to a cutting Naji Marshall. The Mavs have also used Maxi Kleber and P.J. Washington at the five.


The Mavs don’t move the ball much, which has the benefit of fewer opportunities to commit turnovers. And their 9.4 turnovers per 100 possessions is the league’s lowest rate.

The Mavs’ longest homestand of the season (five games over nine days) begins Thursday with a visit from the Rockets and includes three games against the Eastern Conference. They were just 8-7 at home vs. the East last season.

The Clippers are not waiting on Kawhi Leonard. They picked up two quality wins in Week 1, beating the Nuggets and Warriors (with a rest disadvantage) on the road. Their lone loss (vs. Phoenix on Wednesday) came in overtime.
Three takeaways

As noted in this space last week, the Clippers have some dudes that will get after it defensively. It’s on that end where they’ve had success, holding each of their three opponents (who all ranked in the top 10 offensively last season) under 110 points per 100 possessions. Only 42% of their opponents’ shots (the league’s second-lowest opponent rate) have come in the paint, and only 18% of their opponents’ 3-point attempts (third-lowest rate) have come from the corners.


Kris Dunn is one of those dudes, and he ranks fourth in both steals (3.2) and deflections (6.4) per 36 minutes. He picked Kevin Durant’s pocket in the opener and was all in the Warriors’ passing lanes on Sunday.


Ivica Zubac ranks fourth in defensive rebounding percentage (30.7%) and the Clippers rank fourth as a team (75%), having ranked 24th (70.5%) last season.

The Clippers’ longest homestands are two five-game stands, one early in the season and the other late. The first begins with a visit from the Blazers on Wednesday and continues with their second home game against the Suns in nine days.

The Nuggets are off to a rough start and (surprise!) bench minutes have been a problem.
Three takeaways

The Nuggets’ starting lineup outscored the Thunder and Clippers by 18 points (scoring 117 points on 99 offensive possessions) in its 48 total minutes together. All other Denver lineups have been outscored by 36 points (scoring 74 points on 97 offensive possessions) in 48 minutes. They’ve scored an incredibly anemic 28 points on 51 possessions in Nikola Jokić’s 24 minutes on the bench.


The four reserves who’ve played more than the 1:38 of garbage time against Oklahoma City have shot a combined 10-for-43 (23%) from the field, with Russell Westbrook 2-for-18 and Peyton Watson 1-for-10. Westbrook is 1-for-8 in the paint.


The good news from their loss to the Clippers on Saturday afternoon was that Jamal Murray shot 5-for-10 from outside the paint and Jokić was willing to let it fly from deep, attempting a career-high 12 3-pointers. He connected on seven of them, though he missed a shot for the tie with five seconds left, because he was trying to draw a foul.

The Nuggets now head out on a three-game trip that concludes with a big game in Minnesota on Friday. They won three of their five games at the Target Center last season, though the last one was a 45-point loss in Game 6 of the conference semis.

The Grizzlies lost their most important game of Week 1 (Friday in Houston), but won their other two and, more importantly, Jaren Jackson Jr. is back.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies have played three games, but don’t have a lineup that’s played more than 12 minutes together, and Desmond Bane leads the team at just 28.1 minutes per game. Jackson missed the first two games, the expected starters played less than seven minutes together as they clobbered the Magic on Saturday, and they’re playing an 11-man rotation.


The Grizzlies got killed on the glass in Houston, allowing 23 offensive rebounds and 27 second-chance points. After allowing another 21 second-chance points to Orlando on Saturday, they rank 29th in defensive rebounding percentage (60.7%). That number has been lower (57.7%) with starting center Zach Edey on the floor.


Ja Morant has averaged just 25.5 minutes, so his per-game numbers are a little down. Even though the Grizzlies are playing at a fast pace, his drives per 36 minutes (20.8) are a little down from his first five seasons (22.2). He’s just 2-for-12 from 3-point range, but he (10) and Scotty Pippen Jr. (11) are two of the nine players with at least 10 assists on 3-pointers through Week 1.

The Grizzlies are one game into a stretch of six straight against the Eastern Conference and two games into their first stretch of five games in seven days. They’ll have a rest advantage against Brooklyn on Wednesday but will be at a disadvantage the following night against the Bucks.

The Magic’s first week might be a good illustration of the East-West discrepancy this season. After comfortable wins over the Heat and Nets, they got clobbered by the Grizzlies on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The first two opponents shot just 37-80 (46.3%) in the paint, but the Grizzlies shot 31-for-44 (70.5%) as they outscored the Magic by 28 points (62-34) in the paint. That would have been tied for Orlando’s second-worst paint differential last season.


Paint differential might matter less this season, because Magic have taken 49.2% of their shots (third highest rate) from 3-point range, up from 36.9% (25th) last season. Franz Wagner is 10-for-22 (45%) from deep after shooting 21% after the All-Star break (including playoffs) last season and 0-for-7 in the preseason.


The Magic have outscored their opponents by 42 points (an amazing 55.6 per 100 possessions) in the third quarter, but their 21-0, third-quarter run on Sunday only cut a 29-point deficit down to eight. And once the run was over, they never got that close again.

Orlando will play two big games within the Eastern Conference this week, hosting the Pacers on Monday and visiting the Cavs four nights later. As they lost their first-round series to Cleveland in seven games, the two teams combined to score just 102.5 points per 100 possessions.

The Warriors have the two biggest wins for any team this season, beating the Blazers and Jazz by 36 and 41 points, respectively. But they lost their home opener on Sunday and lost Stephen Curry to an ankle injury along the way.
Three takeaways

When you win two games by a total of 77 points, the overall numbers are probably going to be great. On defense, the Warriors held Portland and Utah to just 41-for-91 (45.1%) in the paint, and both teams were even less effective from beyond the arc.


On offense, Buddy Hield was an amazing 12-for-16 (75%) from 3-point range through those first two games, helping the Warriors build big leads when they went to their bench. But it was the offense that really fell off on Sunday when Hield was 1-for-9 from deep, the Warriors committed 21 turnovers and they scored just 37 points on 45 possessions with Curry off the floor.


With Curry in the locker room, the Warriors closed the loss to the Clippers with a backcourt of Hield and Brandon Podziemski. Steve Kerr said that his star’s injury was “mild or moderate,” but if Curry is out this week, Podziemski’s juice off the dribble could be critical to the offense.

The road team won all three games between Golden State and New Orleans last season, with the Pelicans’ 141 points on 99 possessions in January being the most efficient performance the Warriors (who were without Draymond Green) allowed all year. They’ll play a back-to-back at Chase Center on Tuesday and Wednesday.

No Joel Embiid. No Paul George. But the Sixers got off the schneid with an overtime win in Indiana on Sunday … despite some efforts in self-sabotage.
Three takeaways

Tyrese Maxey is trying to do this thing by himself. He’s averaged 31.3 points after scoring 45 (most for any player in Week 1) on Sunday but hasn’t done it very efficiently. His true shooting percentage of 47.2% ranks last among the 44 players who’ve averaged at least 20 points per game, and he’s been assisted on just 20% of his field goals, down from 43% last season.


The Sixers’ offense has been much better with Andre Drummond on the bench, but he’s been critical on the other end of the floor. Philly has grabbed just 56.6% of available defensive rebounds with Drummond on the bench, and he came up with two huge steals late in the fourth quarter on Sunday.


This is the eighth season since the Sixers became a playoff team. Over that stretch (and including playoffs), they’re 304-158 (.658) with Embiid and now 79-85 (.482) without him.

The Pacers’ high-powered offense has yet to get in gear, and the defense has only been good enough to get a six-point win over the Pistons.
Three takeaways

Tyrese Haliburton shot a brutal 1-for-16 from 3-point range over the first two games. He was 4-for-9 against Philadelphia on Sunday (draining a double-clutch 3 to send the game to overtime), but he has just 11 total assists in 98 minutes and the Pacers have scored less than a point per possession with him on the floor.


Turnovers have also been an issue. The Pacers rank 21st in turnover rate (16.6 per 100 possessions) after ranking sixth (12.6 per 100) last season. They committed two straight in the final minute of regulation on Sunday, part of an 8-0 Sixers run that turned a five-point lead into that three-point deficit before Haliburton’s 3 for the tie.


Haliburton isn’t the only one who’s struggled from the perimeter. The Pacers lead the league in field goal percentage in the paint (70%), but rank 28th in effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint (39.5%).

The Pacers were 1-2 against the Magic last season, with the road team winning all three games. The two teams — one a top-three offense and the other a top-three defense last season — will meet twice in the next 10 days.

If you thought the Heat were looking like the No. 8 seed for a third straight season, their Week 1 results — a loss to the Magic and a win in Charlotte — probably didn’t change your mind.
Three takeaways

Perimeter shooting remains an issue. The Heat are 13-for-25 (52%) on corner 3-pointers, but just 4-for-14 (29%) from mid-range and 12-for-43 (28%) on above-the-break 3-pointers. Bam Adebayo is 0-for-8 from outside the paint and the Heat have scored less than a point per possession in his 58 minutes.


They did shoot 3-for-4 on clutch 3-pointers to get the win in Charlotte on Saturday, with Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro each draining above-the-break looks late in the shot clock and the Heat up three. Butler also had almost as many free throw attempts (17) as the Hornets (21) and has the third-highest free throw rate (83 attempts per 100 shots from the field) among 160 players with at least 20 field goal attempts.


The Heat rank last in rebounding percentage (43.7%) by a healthy margin. They were outscored by 28 (45-17) on second-chance points over the two games.

Dejounte Murray had a solid debut with the Pelicans, but fractured his left hand in the process and is out until late November (at the earliest). That simplifies things offensively, but (with Trey Murphy III also out) leaves them a little thin on the bench.
Three takeaways

After coming back from 16 points down to edge the Blazers in Portland on Friday, the Pelicans lost by 22 two nights later in the same building. The difference was defense, and it was more about free throws and rebounds than the Blazers’ shooting. Portland retained 50% of available offensive rebounds on Sunday, with that being the second-highest rate for any team in Week 1 and higher than any rate that the Pelicans allowed all of last season.


After missing the Pelicans’ opening-night win over Chicago, Zion Williamson shot just 7-for-27 (7-for-25 in the paint) in their two games in Portland. Eight (30%) of those 27 shots were blocked, with that being almost triple his rate over his first four seasons (11%). Williamson does have 24 free throw attempts to go with those 27 shots from the field, with that being the second-highest free throw rate among 160 players with at least 20 field goal attempts.


Last season, the Pelicans were 11 points per 100 possessions better in the first halves of games (plus-10.0, second best) than they were in second halves (minus-1.0, 19th), with that being the league’s biggest half-to-half differential by a healthy margin. In Week 1, they were 23.7 points per 100 possessions better after halftime.

The Kings led the Wolves by six with less than nine minutes left and were up seven on the Lakers at the start of the fourth quarter. But they allowed Minnesota to go on a 14-2 run and L.A. to run off 21 straight points. Teams were 37-7 when leading by more than five points in the fourth quarter in Week 1, with the Kings (0-2) and Pistons (0-2) accounting for four of the seven losses.


The Kings’ starting lineup and their (closing) lineup with Malik Monk in place of Kevin Huerter have outscored their opponents by 26 points (26 per 100 possessions) in 45 total minutes, allowing exactly a point per possession. All other lineups have been outscored by 32 points (29.6 per 100 possessions) in 51 minutes, allowing 137 per 100.

Yikes! After beating the shorthanded Sixers on Wednesday, the Bucks lost to Chicago (at home) and Brooklyn by double-digits. Their schedule gets much tougher this week.
Three takeaways

The Bucks were outscored by 42 points (111-69) from 3-point range over the two losses. The Bulls’ 21 3s on Friday were two more than they made in any game last season and just two fewer than the Bucks totaled over the two losses. Damian Lillard was 6-for-12 from beyond the arc in the opener, but just 4-for-19 over the weekend.


The Bucks have protected the paint better, seeing significant drops from last season in both opponent field goal percentage in the paint and the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come in the paint.


But, as was the case last season, they just don’t force turnovers. They ranked last in opponent turnover rate (11.9 per 100 possessions) last season and they’ve seen a significant drop through their first three games (10.4 per 100). That inhibits their ability to run, which is problematic when considering that they have the league’s best transition player.

The Hawks took care of business against the Nets and Hornets, though both games may have been a little too close for comfort. Then they got swamped in the fourth quarter in Oklahoma City on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Hawks have had double-digit leads in all three games, in part because they’ve allowed just 63 points on 78 possessions (80.8 per 100) in the first quarter. They’ve allowed 129.7 per 100 after the first quarter.


It was thought that fouls would be down again this season, but the league has averaged 30 free-throw attempts per 100 shots from the field, up from 24.4 per 100 last season (22.5 per 100 after the All-Star break). The Hawks have seen the biggest jump, from 25.1 per 100 (12th) last season to an amazing 44.8 per 100 (first) this season. And three of their four guys with double-digit attempts — Trae Young, De’Andre Hunter and Onyeka Okongwu — have combined to shoot 58-for-65 (89%) from the stripe.


Okongwu scored a career-high 28 points on 11-for-12 shooting (also blocking three shots) in the win over the Nets on Wednesday. He’s played 15 more minutes than Clint Capela (who averaged more minutes last season) and Okongwu was on the floor instead of Capela down the stretch of the Hawks’ two close games, with Brooklyn and Charlotte combining to score just seven points on 10 clutch possessions.

The Hawks had a rest advantage when they lost in Oklahoma City on Sunday. They’ll be at a disadvantage Monday night against the Wizards, having gone 3-8 (3-4 at home) in rest-disadvantage games last season, with one of those three home losses having come (by 28 points) against Washington.

The Spurs have still outscored both of their opponents in the paint and at the free-throw line.


Over their two games, the Spurs have had 25 fewer shooting opportunities than their opponents, with the average (-12.5 per game) being the worst discrepancy in the league by a wide margin. They’ve committed 15 more turnovers than their opponents, with three of their starters — Wembanyama, Julian Champagnie and Jeremy Sochan — having registered almost twice as many turnovers (19) as assists (10).


The Spurs have been outscored by 26 points (22 per 100 possessions) in Chris Paul’s 55 minutes, though the 39-year-old has registered 11.1 assists per 36 minutes, what would be the second-highest rate of his 20-year career.

The Spurs will host the Rockets again on Monday, then travel to Oklahoma City, where they lost two games by a total of 74 points last season.

The Rockets got a good (and comfortable) win over the Grizzlies on Friday, but that was sandwiched by losses to the Hornets (in which they led by 18 points) and Spurs.
Three takeaways

A big difference between the win and the two losses was rebounding, with the Rockets grabbing 57.5% of available rebounds against Memphis, but just 46.5% over the two defeats. With a big turnover differential (15 fewer than their opponents over the three games), they’ve averaged a league-best 11.1 more shooting opportunities than their opponents.


Though Alperen Sengün wasn’t on the floor down the stretch on Saturday, the Rockets’ starting lineup has played 55 total minutes, the most in the league. It has outscored opponents by 12.9 points per 100 possessions, but bench minutes haven’t been great. Houston was outscored by 17 points in less than 26 minutes with at least one reserve on the floor in the five-point loss to Charlotte.


Amen Thompson might be one of those wings who plays like a center on offense. Early in the Charlotte game, he was completely ignored at the 3-point line. Later, he was the guy setting screens and rolling to the rim, even with Jabari Smith Jr. and Sengün on the floor.

The Rockets will play in San Antonio again on Monday before finishing their three-game trip in Dallas. The Mavs were responsible for three of the 17 times the Rockets allowed more than 125 points per 100 possessions last season.

With 22 of their first 25 games against teams that had winning records last season, the Raptors probably weren’t complaining when the Sixers were without Joel Embiid and Paul George on Friday. They took care of business against their shorthanded opponent to get their only win of Week 1.
Three takeaways

The Raptors began the season without RJ Barrett, Bruce Brown and Kelly Olynyk. Then they lost Immanuel Quickley to a hard fall in the first half of Game 1, and the attrition had somebody named Jamison Battle in the rotation. The undrafted rookie fouled out in less than 15 minutes against Philly, but he has an effective field-goal percentage of 68% on 17 shots over the three games and (even when you discount their blowout loss to the Cavs) the Raptors have been at their best with reserves on the floor.


Battle was one of three Raptors who have averaged more than 10 rebounds per 36 minutes. Toronto leads the league in total rebounding percentage (56.9%), having ranked 27th (48.4%) last season.


If you can get back in transition and keep the Raptors off the glass, you’re in good shape defensively. Through three games, 35% of their points have been fast break points or second-chance points, with that rate up from a league-high 29% last season.

The Raptors’ first game against a team that had a losing record last season is Wednesday in Charlotte, with the Hornets being one of two teams that the Raptors beat three times in ’23-24. Barrett is listed as questionable for their game against the Nuggets on Monday.

The Bulls are 1-2, but the one win was in Milwaukee, with the Bulls having lost 25 of their previous 30 games against the Bucks.
Three takeaways

As was the case in the preseason, the Bulls have seen the league’s biggest jump in 3-point rate, taking 48.9% of their shots from beyond the arc (fifth highest), up from 35.8% (29th) last season. They outscored the Bucks by 24 points (63-39) from 3-point range in their win on Friday.


The flip side of the increase in 3-pointers is that only Boston (36%) has taken a lower percentage of their shots in the paint than Chicago (40%). The Bulls have been outscored by 16 points per game (the league’s worst discrepancy) in the restricted area.


The Bulls won the turnover battle (10-15) in Milwaukee, but their turnover differential against the Thunder (26-10) was the worst of the season so far, while their differential in New Orleans (21-12) is tied for the fourth worst. Zach LaVine has 15 turnovers and just seven assists. (Chicago ranked third in turnover differential last season.)

The Bulls will continue to alternate home and road games for the next 17 days. With the Milwaukee win, they’re 1-0 against 2024 East playoff teams, having gone 10-20 against them last season. They’re set to host the Magic (who’ve seen the second-biggest jump in 3-point rate) on Wednesday.

The Hornets have trailed all three of their games by at least 14 points. They got a nice comeback win in Houston on Wednesday, but the comebacks fell short against the Hawks and Heat.
Three takeaways

Those deficits have come via some ugly offensive starts, with the Hornets scoring just 60 points on 76 first-quarter possessions (78.9 per 100). Tre Mann has come off the bench and shot 1-for-10 (0-for-5 from 3-point range) in the opening 12 minutes.


But Mann is the only guy who has been on the floor for all nine minutes of clutch time, and the Hornets had the ball in his hands on some (scripted) possessions late in the Houston win. He drained a wicked step-back 3 over Jalen Green and a tough floater on a drive against Dillon Brooks.


The Hornets are one of two teams (the Clippers are the other) that have played three games that were within five points in the last five minutes. Against Miami and Atlanta, they didn’t get enough stops down the stretch. Overall, the Hornets have allowed 33 points on 23 clutch defensive possessions.

Their rest-disadvantage loss to the Heat on Saturday was the start of a four-game homestand that concludes with a weekend back-to-back against the Celtics. First, they’ll host the Raptors, with all four Charlotte-Toronto meetings last season having been within five points in the last five minutes.

The Blazers lost Game 1 by 36 points, lost Game 2 by two, and won Game 3 by 22. So at that rate of progression, they’ll win the final game of the season by 2,313 points.
Three takeaways

After allowing 119 points on just 84 possessions (142 per 100) over the final 36 minutes of their opening-night loss to the Warriors, the Blazers allowed just 104.5 per 100 in their two games against the Pelicans. The Warriors (unsurprisingly) shot better from 3-point range, but the bigger difference was in the paint, where Golden State shot 72% and New Orleans shot just 46% (with Zion Williamson just 7-for-25).


Over the two games, the Blazers outscored the Pelicans by 26 points (88-62) in the restricted area. Portland ranked 29th in restricted-area differential (-5.3 points per game) last season.


The offense broke out on Sunday when Jerami Grant and Anfernee Simons combined to score 55 points (Deandre Ayton added 17 on 7-for-9 shooting). The Blazers’ three highest-paid players played just 19 games together last season.

Having played their first three games at home, the Blazers will now play six of their next seven on the road, and they’ll be at a rest disadvantage in Sacramento on Monday. They were 5-4 (3-1 on the road) in rest-disadvantage games last season.

The Nets were somewhat competitive in road losses to the Hawks and Magic, and new coach Jordi Fernandez got his first win against the Bucks on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Cam Thomas’ low usage rate in the preseason was a ruse and he leads the Nets in regular-season usage rate by a healthy margin. But he’s also taken more efficient shots as he’s averaged 30.7 points in 34.6 minutes per game. He’s taken 66% of his shots from the restricted area or 3-point range, up from just 49% over his first three seasons.


It’s good that Ben Simmons is healthy, but the Nets have been much better with him off the floor (plus 18.6 points per 100 possessions) than they’ve been with him on it (minus 21.2). Their lineup with Nic Claxton in Simmons’ place (with the other four starters) is a plus-17 in less than 13 minutes.


The Nets somehow have an opponent free-throw rate of 48 attempts per 100 shots from the field, which would (not surprisingly) be the highest opponent rate in (at least) the last 55 years. Simmons (7.0), Jalen Wilson (6.4) and Ziaire Williams (6.1) are three of the eight players (league-wide) who’ve played at least 50 minutes and averaged more than six fouls per 36.

The Nets have a league-high 15 rest-advantage games this season, with the first of the 15 against the Nuggets on Tuesday. But that’s also the start of their first stretch of five games in seven days, with both rest-disadvantage games in that stretch coming against the Grizzlies.

The Pistons impressively erased a 23-point deficit and almost handed Boston its first loss on Saturday, but they’re 0-3 for the seventh time in the last 15 years.
Three takeaways

Two of the three losses were within five points in the last five minutes, but the Pistons just couldn’t get the buckets they needed to get a win, scoring just 11 points on 16 clutch possessions, with Cade Cunningham and Tobias Harris each shooting 0-for-4 in the clutch. Last season, the Pistons scored less than a point per clutch possession in 15 of their first 20 games that were within five points in the last five minutes.


After shooting 8-for-14 from mid-range in the preseason, Cunningham is 7-for-13 (54%) through three games. He was doing some nice work in the post (three straight scores) against the Pacers on Wednesday, and is tied for second with 12 total post-up points, according to Synergy tracking.


Going back to the start of last season, the Pistons are now 0-33 against the eight 2024 Eastern Conference playoff teams.

They’ll get three more chances to get a win against that group this week. Three of their four losses to the Heat last season were within five points in the last five minutes, and they’ll be in Miami on Monday.

For the first time in 10 years (since the 2014-15 season), the Jazz are off to an 0-2 start.
Three takeaways

Last season, Lauri Markkanen had a positive plus-minus (the Jazz outscored their opponents by 0.6 points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor) for a team that was 31-51. On Wednesday, he was a plus-16 (in almost 35 minutes) in a game the Jazz lost by two. Over their two games last week, the Jazz scored 115.2 points per 100 possessions with Markkanen on the floor and just 74.4 per 100 (58 on 78) with him off the floor.


The defensive numbers were not good whether Markkanen was on the floor or not. Bad defense for the Jazz, once again, begins with transition. They allowed the Grizzlies and Warriors to average 35.5 transition points per game, a rate that would destroy the record for most allowed in the 21 seasons of Synergy data.


Their issues with transition defense have again begun with turnovers. The Jazz have committed 18.8 per 100 possessions (second most), with their starting backcourt — Keyonte George and Collin Sexton — having as many total turnovers (14) as assists (14). George has also shot just 7-for-30, including just 3-for-16 inside the arc.

The Wizards have played two of the four teams that are 3-0, and this is the first time in 31 years (since 1993) that they’ve begun their season with two double-digit losses.
Three takeaways

It’s been a rough start defensively, with the Wizards ranking in the bottom five in both opponent 2-point percentage (57.4%, 26th) and opponent 3-point percentage (41.7%, 30th).


Rookie Alex Sarr has been starting at the five, with Jonas Valančiūnas coming off the bench, though the starting lineup has played just 19 total minutes together over the two games. It’s scored a pretty anemic 34 points on 42 possessions (81 per 100) in those 19 minutes, having shot 4-for-20 from 3-point range. Jordan Poole is actually 10-for-18 from deep, but Kyle Kuzma (0-for-9) and (reserve) rookie Kyshawn George (0-for-8) are two of the three players (Cam Whitmore is the other) with at least eight 3-point attempts and no makes.


The Wizards were also outscored by 15 points (allowing 47 on 33 possessions) in 15 minutes with Sarr and Valančiūnas on the floor together. (They were a minus-27 in 29 preseason minutes together.)

The last time the Wizards were in Atlanta was one of the three times last season that the Hawks scored less than a point per possession. The two teams play a home-and-home set before the Wizards head to Mexico City to face the Heat.

The champs have brought everybody back, but the roster may be too expensive beyond this season, so there remains a sense of urgency.
Preseason takeaways

Kristaps Porzingis is out and Al Horford only played in the preseason finale, but the Celtics were still dominant through their first four games, leading three of them by more than 30 points. Last season, the Celtics had the highest-rated bench in the 28 years for which we have play-by-play data, and bench minutes were terrific once again, with Boston outscoring its opponents by 41 points per 100 possessions in Sam Hauser’s 70 minutes.


Porzingis is the ultimate floor spacer, but the Celtics still led the league (by a wide margin) in 3-point rate without him, taking 55.4% of their shots from beyond the arc. The other side of that is that only 11 (19%) of Jayson Tatum’s 58 shots came in the paint.

Something to watch in Week 1: Focus. The Celtics were relentless last season, especially in the playoffs. It’s going to be fascinating to see if they keep their foot on the gas over the next 25 weeks, or if some complacency sits in.
A game against the new-look Knicks on ring night should have the Celtics’ full attention, but the schedule gets soft after that. Six of their next seven games are on the road, but five of those six are against teams that had losing records last season. They’re playing 27 of their first 31 games within the Eastern Conference.

The only way that expectations could be higher for the Thunder would be if the Celtics didn’t exist. This team has won just a single playoff series over the last eight seasons, but 80% of the league’s GMs picked it to win the Western Conference.
Preseason takeaways

Jalen Williams averaged 31.3 points per 36 minutes on an effective field goal percentage of 65.5%. He took 17 (40%) of his 42 shots from 3-point range, a jump from 25% over his first two seasons in the league. The flip side is that his free throw rate (four free throw attempts, 42 field goal attempts) would have ranked 247th among the 261 players with at least 300 field goal attempts last season.


Isaiah Hartenstein averaged 14.1 points, 13.4 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 2.0 steals and 2.0 blocks per 36 minutes, with the Thunder outscoring their opponents (the Spurs, Rockets and Nuggets) by more than 30 points per 100 possessions in his 54 minutes on the floor. But then he suffered a fractured hand that will have him out for at least the first 16 games of the regular season.

Something to watch in Week 1: Rebounding. Hartenstein’s absence puts the Thunder’s rebounding back in the spotlight. They were one of two teams to rank in the bottom five in both offensive and defensive rebounding percentage last season, and they weren’t much better on the glass in the preseason, especially when you subtract their game against the New Zealand Breakers.
The Thunder open the season in Denver, having gone 3-1 against the Nuggets last season. They got destroyed on the glass in their October loss, but outrebounded the Nuggets over their three wins.

It’s amazing how much the Knicks have overhauled their roster in the last 10 months, adding OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns via trade. Of course, Jalen Brunson remains the centerpiece.
Preseason takeaways

The Knicks’ starting lineup played 80 preseason minutes together, with that being the most for any preseason lineup by a wide margin. It had one great game (plus-23 in 22.4 minutes) against the Wizards but was otherwise outscored by six points and shot just 15-for-63 (24%) from 3-point range over its four total games together.


As of Monday morning, the Knicks had 12 players under contract (not including two-way deals). Two of them — Mitchell Robinson and Precious Achiuwa — are unavailable to start the season, and another two — Pacôme Dadiet and Tyler Kolek — are rookies taken with the 25th and 34th picks in the Draft. So regarding experienced players on their bench, they have Cameron Payne (6-foot-3), Miles McBride (6–foot-1) and Jericho Sims (27 total playoff minutes last season).

Something to watch in Week 1: Depth and size. See above. The Towns trade left the Knicks a little thin (and small) on the wings, and the injuries have left them thin up front. It’s probably not yet time for Josh Hart to play 48 minutes a night, so some inexperienced guys will need to be thrown into the fire and the Knicks might not have the rebounding advantage that they’ve had in the past.
The Knicks have a fun start to the season, playing their first four games against the Celtics, Pacers, Cavs and Heat. They were 12-15 (fifth best) in games played between the top eight teams in the East last season, though that breaks down to 5-1 with Anunoby and 7-14 without him.

A year ago in this space: “This is the year when we find out if the Wolves can continue to employ both Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns.”
With Minnesota having its best season in 20 years and reaching the conference finals, the answer seemed to be “Yes, they can.” Then, they traded Towns just before training camp.
Preseason takeaways

Julius Randle played in just one game, a loss in Chicago that Naz Reid missed. So we haven’t seen what the Wolves’ frontline rotation might look like and if there are any minutes available for Luka Garza, who averaged 30.2 points per 36 minutes on an effective field goal percentage of 70.2% in the preseason. Those marks were in the top six among players who played at least 50 minutes and among players with at least 35 field goal attempts, respectively.


Donte DiVincenzo should keep the floor spaced for Anthony Edwards, and his ability to handle some playmaking duties should help keep 37-year-old Mike Conley fresh. DiVincenzo averaged 6.9 assists per 36 minutes (with an assist/turnover ratio of 4.25) in the preseason. Conley played in both games of 10 of the Wolves’ 13 back-to-backs last season, but it wouldn’t be a surprise if that number was much lower this year.

Something to watch in Week 1: Randle’s defense. The Bulls scored 71 points on 55 possessions (129 per 100) with Randle on the floor on Wednesday. Not much of that was his fault, even if he seemed to be short on gas when he’d been on the floor for a while. But it could be a challenge for him to meet the high standard that the Wolves set on that end of the floor last season.
After they visit the Lakers and Kings (who both ranked in the middle of the pack) this week, seven of the Wolves’ next 10 games will be against teams that ranked in the bottom 10 offensively last season.

The Nuggets have seemingly taken another step backward, losing starter Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in free agency. But they still have the best player in the world.
Preseason takeaways

The Nuggets ranked last defensively in the preseason, but the defensive numbers were good (102.2 points allowed per 100 possessions) in 39 minutes with their starters on the floor. Overall, they were a plus-15 in Nikola Jokić’s 93 minutes and outscored by 73 points in 147 minutes with the MVP off the floor.


They also outscored their opponents by 12.6 per 100 in 49 minutes with Russell Westbrook and Julian Strawther on the floor together. We probably can’t expect that duo to shoot 51% from 3-point range in the regular season, but we can expect Westbrook to push the pace. The Nuggets averaged more than 112 possessions per 48 minutes when he played in the preseason.

Something to watch in Week 1: Jamal Murray. There are always going to be questions about the Nuggets’ depth, and it remains to be seen if Christian Braun can replicate what Caldwell-Pope gave them on both ends of the floor. But none of that matters if Murray doesn’t return to form after a rough postseason and even rougher Olympics performance.

The Suns were a disappointment last season, losing in the first round of the playoffs with a pricey and talented trio of stars. But Mike Budenholzer and Tyus Jones are here to address some of their issues.
Preseason takeaways

The Suns saw the league’s third biggest jump in 3-point rate (3PA/FGA), from 37.8% (21st) last season to 47.5% (sixth) in the preseason. Bradley Beal, Devin Booker and Kevin Durant had a ratio of 1.6 3-point attempts (56) for every mid-range attempt (35), up from 1.1 last season.


The Suns were also one of only two teams — the Knicks were the other — that committed fewer turnovers per 100 possessions (14.8, seventh lowest) than they did last season (15.0, 25th). And that was with Jones having a much lower assist/turnover ratio (21/5, 4.20) than he’s had in any of the last six seasons.

Something to watch in Week 1: The results. Beal, Booker and Durant are healthy to start the season, a much different scenario than a year ago, when they didn’t play together until Dec. 13. The Suns were 18-10 (in the regular season) against the other 17 teams that had winning records when all three were available.
The Suns will play 19 of their first 23 games against those teams that finished above .500 last season, starting with two games in L.A. and a big home opener on Saturday, when they’ll be at a rest-disadvantage against the Western Conference champs.

The defending Western Conference champs made some changes — swapping Josh Green and Derrick Jones Jr. for Naji Marshall and Klay Thompson — that may or may not make them better.
Preseason takeaways

Luka Dončić missed the entire preseason with a calf contusion, but was a full participant in practice over the weekend, with the Mavs not set to play until Thursday. Dončić accounted for more than a third of the Mavs’ made 3-pointers when he was on the floor last season and without him, they saw the league’s biggest drop (by a huge margin) in 3-point rate in the preseason. Dereck Lively II did attempt a 3, though, bringing down some rain with a miss against the Clippers.


Klay Thompson struggled offensively, going 0-for-5 in the paint, 1-for-6 from mid-range and 6-for-18 (33%) on 3-pointers. The Mavs scored a paltry 86.4 points per 100 possessions in his 57 total minutes.

Something to watch in Week 1: The Dončić-Irving-Thompson minutes. Despite Thompson’s offensive struggles in the preseason, the bigger question is how well the Mavs will defend when he’s on the floor with Dončić and Kyrie Irving. It will be fascinating to see who’s guarding Bradley Beal and Devin Booker at the start of their game in Phoenix on Saturday.
The Mavs will play seven of their first nine games at home, and they’ll have a rest advantage in that road game against the Suns. They were just 5-5 (1-2 on the road) in rest-advantage games last season.

Is Paul George the guy who can help Joel Embiid finally get past the conference semifinals? No matter what George does over the next eight months, it’s still about mostly about how healthy Embiid is in April and May.
Preseason takeaways

Embiid didn’t play, while George and Tyrese Maxey played just 34 minutes (over two games) together. George injured his knee last Monday, while Maxey suffered a thumb contusion on Friday. It will seemingly take some time for the Sixers’ three stars to figure things out and, hopefully, this isn’t a situation like last season’s Suns (where the three stars didn’t play together until Game 24).


With Embiid hinting that he won’t play in both games of back-to-backs (the Sixers have 15), Andre Drummond’s role is more important. Drummond’s rebounding raises the Sixers’ floor in the non-Embiid games and minutes. In the preseason, he grabbed 28.8% of available boards, easily the highest rate among 432 players who averaged at least 10 minutes in two games or more. (Turnovers will be an issue, though.)

Something to watch in Week 1: Embiid’s post-up frequency. When Embiid is healthy and engaged, he gets into the post and demands the ball. When he’s feeling less than 100%, he’s much more likely to drift on the perimeter and shoot jumpers.
The Sixers have a couple of big tests in Week 1, hosting the Bucks on Wednesday and visiting the Pacers over the weekend. They had the worst record (10-15) in games played between the eight Eastern Conference playoff teams last season, with that mark breaking down to 5-6 with Embiid and 5-9 without him.

When he was in Brooklyn, coach Kenny Atkinson never got the chance to take a good team to the next level. But he’s getting that chance in Cleveland with a team that needs its best players to play better together.
Preseason takeaways

Atkinson was pretty liberal in staggering the minutes of Darius Garland and Donovan Mitchell, who played 52 minutes together and 51 (total) minutes apart. The numbers were almost the same for the combination of Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen. The Cavs were outscored by 8.9 points per 100 possessions (with bad defensive numbers) in 48 minutes with all four on the floor.


Mobley took seven (23%) of his 31 shots from 3-point range. That’s not a particularly high rate, but it’s about double his rate from last season (10.7%). Only one of those seven attempts came from the corners, though.

Something to watch in Week 1: Dean Wade’s minutes. The Cavs were at their best last season (plus-8.3 points per 100 possessions) with Wade on the floor, in part because most of his minutes were as the floor-spacing four when only Mobley or Allen were in the game. With Max Strus (ankle sprain) out for more than a month, Wade should see some extra playing time, both at the four and at the three (where he started the preseason finale).
The Cavs begin their season with games against three of the four worst teams in the Eastern Conference last season. In 2023-24, they were just 14-4 (seventh-best among the top 10) against the East’s bottom five.

Off a surprise trip to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pacers are back for a full season with Pascal Siakam alongside Tyrese Haliburton.
Preseason takeaways

The defense was not good, and it was at its worst (more than 120 points allowed per 100 possessions) with the Pacers’ starters on the floor. The Pacers did experiment with some zone, playing more zone possessions in the preseason (18) than they did all of last season (11), according to Synergy tracking.


The Pacers might have a little more reliable depth this season. Bennedict Mathurin is back from injury, Jarace Walker could be ready to play in his second season and James Wiseman showed signs that he could help, shooting 17-for-24 (71%) and averaging 16.2 rebounds per 36 minutes.

Something to watch in Week 1: The defensive shot chart. The Pacers’ 24th-ranked defense allowed their opponents to take 55.7% of their shots in the paint, the highest opponent rate (by a wide margin) in the last 25 years. We’ll see if they’re willing to allow more 3-pointers to make rim protection a greater priority.
The last time the Pacers were in Madison Square Garden, they shot a playoff-record 67.1% from the floor to win Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. They’ll be back on Friday, the start of a stretch of seven straight games against teams that had winning records last season.

Are the Bucks still a title contender or has their time passed? We will find out in the next eight months.
Preseason takeaways

The Bucks were, statistically, the worst team in the preseason. But they were a plus-21 in just 34 minutes with Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo on the floor together. Their worst on-court numbers belonged to players at the end of the bench.


Though those 34 minutes with Lillard accounted for 85% of Antetokounmpo’s total time on the floor, he led the preseason in usage rate (41.4%) by a huge margin. And none of his 31 shots came from 3-point range.

Something to watch in Week 1: Wing play. It seems doubtful that Khris Middleton, who missed the entire preseason, will be available when the Bucks play in Philadelphia on Wednesday. Even if he is, you have to assume that his minutes will be limited for some time. So the Bucks’ wing depth will be tested early. They’ll certainly need more from Pat Connaughton, who has shot just 34% from 3-point range over the last two seasons.
The Bucks are playing 28 or 29 of their first 32 games within the Eastern Conference, and for the third straight year, they’ll open their schedule against the Sixers. Milwaukee won the previous two openers by a total of three points.

The Pelicans appear to have the most unsettled roster, with four guys who need the ball in their hands and the lack of a starting-caliber center. But this team ranked sixth in the league in point differential last season, and it now has more offensive talent.
Preseason takeaways

Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson didn’t play together, with the former missing the Pelicans’ first two games, one game being canceled, and the latter missing the preseason finale on Tuesday. And Williamson played just 21 total minutes alongside both Dejounte Murray and CJ McCollum.


Jordan Hawkins could be in position to get some more minutes in his second year, especially if Trey Murphy III (hamstring strain) isn’t ready to start the season (and if the Pels play Williamson at the five). Hawkins was far from bashful in the preseason, averaging 31.6 points per 36 minutes, second most among 340 players who played at least 50 total minutes.

Something to watch in Week 1: Small ball? There was another big — Daniel Theis, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl or Yves Missi — on the floor for all of Williamson’s 36 preseason minutes. Will Robinson-Earl or Missi be in the regular-season rotation, or will we see some minutes with Williamson at the five? The Pels outscored their opponents by 8.6 points per 100 possessions in 366 minutes with him at the five last season.
The Pelicans have a league-high 10 two-game series (no other team has more than seven), where they’re playing the same team in two straight games. The first two are a four-game trip (starting Friday) where they’re visiting the Blazers and Warriors.

One of the league’s most improved teams last season still has a very young core, though it added a vet (Kentavious Caldwell-Pope) to help it take the next step.
Preseason takeaways

It was just three games (they had one canceled), but it was the same ol’ Magic. They were in the bottom 10 on offense and sixth on defense, combining with their opponents to score just 101.8 points per 100 possessions. The numbers were even uglier (85 scored and 89 allowed per 100) in the starting lineup’s 33 minutes.


If Franz Wagner has fixed his jumper, he’s waiting until the regular season to show it off. After shooting 17-for-92 (18%) from 3-point range after the All-Star break last season, 9-for-34 (26%) in the playoffs and 7-for-35 (20%) in the Olympics, he was 0-for-7 in the preseason. Jett Howard (who might replace Caleb Houstan in the rotation) was the only Magic player who shot well (7-for-17) on more than six attempts from beyond the arc.

Something to watch in Week 1: Offense. Preseason doesn’t count, but the 3-point shooting is still a little discouraging for a franchise that has ranked in the bottom 10 offensively in each of the last 12 seasons. If the Magic are going to take another step forward, they have to find a way to be, like, close to average on that end of the floor.
They’ll begin the season with a tough test of their offense, visiting the Heat on Wednesday. The Magic are playing seven of their first nine (and 16 of their first 25) games on the road.

Klay Thompson is gone, but Stephen Curry and Draymond Green remain, and the Warriors have retooled to remain competitive. You could certainly make the argument that the supporting cast is stronger than it was a year ago.
Preseason takeaways

The Warriors were the only undefeated team in the preseason, also outscoring their opponents by 24.1 points per 100 possessions, the league’s second-best mark, in the first quarter (the quarter that most resembles regular-season basketball). That mark drops (to plus-14.6 per 100) when you throw out their 36-18 first quarter on Friday (when Stephen Curry and the entire Lakers rotation didn’t play).


The Warriors were better offensively each of the last two seasons (ranking 10th and ninth on that end) than they were when they won the championship in 2021-22 (16th). But you have to wonder if there’s a ceiling on this season’s offense given that five of their top 12 guys — Kyle Anderson, Draymond Green, Trayce Jackson-Davis, Kevon Looney and Gary Payton II — could cramp their spacing. Of course, Anderson, Green and Payton combined to shoot 12-for-25 (48%) from 3-point range in the preseason.

Something to watch in Week 1: The closing lineup. The Warriors led the league with 48 games that were within five points in the last five minutes last season, they had eight guys who played at least 45 clutch minutes, and coach Steve Kerr might have more options this year. There will definitely be some offense-defense substitutions, but it seems that anybody could get the call down the stretch of a close game.
The Warriors were 16-2 (9-1 on the road) against the five Western Conference teams that finished at or below .500 last season, and they’ll begin this one with visits to the only two teams — the Blazers and Jazz — that they beat four times. They’ll have a rest advantage in their home opener against the Clippers on Sunday.

DeMar DeRozan in Sacramento will be one of the most interesting experiments in the league. If it works, the Kings could be back in the top six in the West.
Preseason takeaways

It was not a good preseason for the Kings. They were one of two NBA teams that didn’t win a game. And while the worst on-court marks belonged to deep reserves, they were also outscored by 15.5 points per 100 possessions in 67 minutes with DeRozan, De’Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis on the floor together.


With DeRozan comes an increase in mid-range shots. He led the league with 20 mid-range attempts in the preseason and the Kings had the lowest ratio of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts (3.0 to 1), having had the fifth-highest ratio (4.4 to 1) last season. So they’ll be working against the math a little bit more than they’re used to.

Something to watch in Week 1: The wing rotation. Even if Kevin Huerter (who missed the entire preseason) is available this week, the Kings are a little thin on the wing, to the point that Doug McDermott (who they signed five days ago) might be in the rotation.
The Kings were one of four teams that scored more than 120 points per 100 possessions multiple times against the Wolves’ top-ranked defense last season, doing it in two wins in Minnesota. They’ll open the season with the Wolves in Sacramento on Thursday.

The Heat have been the No. 8 seed in the East each of the last two seasons. The first time, they made a miracle run to The Finals. But six months ago, they got clobbered in the first round. The best way to avoid that same fate is to be better in the regular season.
Preseason takeaways

The Heat rested their rotation in Memphis on Friday, but otherwise took the preseason somewhat seriously. Jimmy Butler had normal hair on Media Day and the starting lineup played 57 preseason minutes together, second most in the league. Butler’s four games were as many as he played in the last three preseasons combined.


Butler made the most of his availability, registering a true shooting percentage of 77.5%, the third-highest mark among 231 players with at least 25 field goal attempts. He took just one mid-range jumper, shot 13-for-18 in the paint and had 18 free throw attempts to go along with his 25 shots from the field. The man still knows how to get to the line.

Something to watch in Week 1: Early offense. Last season, the Heat took 22.4% of their shots, the league’s third-highest rate, in the last seven seconds of the shot clock. In the preseason, they were looking to get the ball up the floor more quickly, often pushing off of made baskets on the other end. Getting a few more easy baskets a night would help them not rank in the bottom 10 offensively for a third straight season.
The Heat had the league’s second-best division record last season, going 13-3 within the Southeast. They’ll open this season with games against the Magic (3-1) and Hornets (4-0), having been responsible (even though they had a bottom-10 offense overall) for two of the 14 games where Orlando’s third-ranked defense allowed more than 120 points per 100 possessions).

The last time the Grizzlies were healthy, they were the No. 2 seed in the West. But while Ja Morant, Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr. are still here, the supporting cast is very different from two seasons ago.
Preseason takeaways

Zach Edey will be the starting center, though we didn’t get to see him alongside Jackson, who missed the entire preseason with a hamstring issue. The Grizzlies will let Edey operate in the paint, and his 22 post-up possessions (on which he shot 7-for-14) were the most in the preseason per Synergy tracking.


Floor spacing will be a big question, as has been the case in Memphis for the last few years. Three of the projected starters — Morant, Edey and Marcus Smart — were a combined 1-for-12 from 3-point range in the preseason. Jackson (32.6% on 3-pointers in the last four seasons) has never established himself as a serious threat out there, either.

Something to watch in Week 1: The results. This week could tell us a lot about the Grizzlies’ ability to return to the top of the Western Conference. They’re not playing any other West contenders, but the question is if they can take care of business against the Jazz, Rockets and Magic (at home).
The Grizzlies’ game in Houston on Friday is also the start of their first stretch of five games in seven days. So their depth, with GG Jackson and Vince Williams Jr. out to start the season, could be tested early.

The Rockets were the league’s most improved team last season, and if their trajectory continues in the positive direction, they’ll be competing for a playoff spot in the West.
Preseason takeaways

If you watched the first four minutes of their game in Oklahoma City, you’d conclude that the Rockets were going to really struggle offensively again this season. The starters (missing Fred VanVleet) couldn’t get good shots (often forcing bad ones) as they scored just two points on their first eight possessions against a really good defensive team. But Houston had the fourth-ranked offense in the preseason, scoring an amazing 131 points per 100 possessions in VanVleet’s 68 minutes, even though he shot just 6-for-23.


Reed Sheppard shot just 2-for-11 from beyond the arc and had just a single free throw attempt, but was money (6-for-8) from mid-range. (His teammates were 5-for-30.) The Rockets’ win over the Spurs on Thursday was somewhat of a dress rehearsal, and the rookie got the most first-half minutes (13:37) off the bench.

Something to watch in Week 1: Amen Thompson. Overall, the second-year wing saw the most preseason minutes among the Rockets’ reserves, and he started the game that VanVleet missed, even handling the ball a bit. Thompson saw a jump in efficiency after the All-Star break last season, seems primed for another leap in Year 2, and might even be a guy the Rockets turn to down the stretch of close games.
Based on last season’s numbers, the Rockets’ first four games are their easiest stretch of the season. But the Grizzlies (who they’ll host on Friday) and Spurs (who they’ll play twice in San Antonio) could be the league’s two most improved teams.

The Lakers had the West’s 11th best point differential last season, with Anthony Davis and LeBron James missing only six and 11 games, respectively. Is there a way for them to get better?
Preseason takeaways

Last season, the Lakers averaged 3.5 fewer shooting opportunities than their opponents, the league’s worst discrepancy, with one issue being that they ranked 29th in offensive rebounding percentage. They were even with their opponents in regard to shooting opportunities in the preseason, ranking 15th in offensive rebounding percentage. But that latter number was more about the reserves than the starters, with Anthony Davis grabbing just 4.9% of available offensive boards while he was on the floor, down from 9.3% last season.


They ranked third in total zone possessions (20) in the preseason, putting Davis at the top of a 3-2. Pulling one of the league’s best interior defenders away from the basket may seem counterintuitive, but they could try to attack that shot discrepancy by forcing more turnovers.

Something to watch in Week 1: Father and son. We don’t know how much longer the elder James will play, so we should appreciate him while he’s still among the best players in the league. And why not enjoy the inevitable (and unprecedented) father-and-son moment, even with the knowledge that Bronny James needs a lot more development before he might be able to contribute to more than something ceremonial.
The Lakers begin their season with five games against teams that had winning records last season. The first three of those are at home, though they’ll be at a rest disadvantage when they host the Kings (against whom they’ve lost eight of their last nine games) on Saturday.

Paul George is in Philadelphia and Kawhi Leonard is still dealing with knee issues. So the Clippers are apparently left with the James Harden System as they begin their first season at the Intuit Dome.
Preseason takeaways

Whether or not Leonard is available, the Clippers must lean into a defensive identity. There’s potential on that end of the floor after seeing Terance Mann and Derrick Jones Jr. harass the Blazers into four turnovers in the first five minutes in their meeting in Seattle. With Kris Dunn and Nicolas Batum in the rotation as well, Leonard (when he plays) doesn’t need to be at his best on that end of the floor for this to be a very good defensive team.


Those defenders also must make shots. Dunn airballed his first 3-point attempt of the preseason and combined with Jones to shoot just 3-for-15 from beyond the arc. Mann, meanwhile, attempted just seven threes in 76 minutes.

Something to watch in Week 1: Defense. The Clippers will need offense from sources other than Harden, but they can remain competitive by playing at a top-10 level on the other end of the floor. (Harden has been on five top-10 defenses in his 15-year career.) Five of their first six games are against teams that ranked in the top 10 offensively last season.
It would be nice if Leonard was available for what would be a really fun first week — games against the Suns, Nuggets and Warriors — that could give us an early peek at where the Clippers stand in the Western Conference. Alas…

With Dejounte Murray in New Orleans, it’s back to the Trae Young Show in Atlanta, though the continued development of Jalen Johnson may be what determines how good the Hawks are.
Preseason takeaways

Murray attempted more than twice as many mid-range shots (260) as any two of his teammates last season. In the preseason, the Hawks had the league’s highest ratio of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts (10.1/1), while also seeing its third biggest jump in assist rate.


It appears that the Hawks will start Young, Dyson Daniels, De’Andre Hunter, Johnson and Clint Capela. That group has the potential to be pretty good defensively, though the same lineup with Murray in Daniels’ place allowed 119 points per 100 possessions in 172 total minutes last season.

Something to watch in Week 1: Zaccharie Risacher’s ability to contribute right away. The No. 1 pick looked very comfortable in the preseason, scoring 32 total points (25.2 per 36 minutes) in a myriad of ways and on 12-for-20 shooting. If he’s not in the starting lineup, he’ll get a lot of minutes off the bench, and it will be critical for the Hawks to find ways to score when Young is off the floor.
The Hawks visit Oklahoma City on Sunday, but their first five games might still be their easiest stretch of the season, because that game against the Thunder is sandwiched by four games against the Nets, Hornets and Wizards (x 2).

The Raptors are one of those teams that don’t have a very low floor or a very high ceiling. But they’ve got a lot invested in the trio of Scottie Barnes, RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley.
Preseason takeaways

That trio didn’t play together in the preseason, with Quickley (thumb injury) missing the first four games and Barrett (shoulder injury) missing the last four. But the Raptors were good when their rotation guys played, and they outscored their opponents by 15.0 points per 100 possessions in 78 total minutes with their other two returning starters —  Barnes and Jakob Pöltl — on the floor together. The context is that three of their five games were against the Nets and Wizards. But they also had a 46-27 first quarter in Boston, with Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Derrick White in the lineup for the Celtics.

Dick is in the starting lineup by necessity and the Raptors were one of two teams that ranked in the bottom five in both 3-point percentage (34.7%, 27th) and the percentage of their shots that came from 3-point range (36.9%, 26th) last season. They were again in the bottom five in the latter in the preseason. They can’t expect to be so dominant in the paint in the regular season, and they’ll need Dick (and others) to let it fly from beyond the arc.
Barrett’s status to start the season is unknown and the Raptors have a brutal schedule over the next seven weeks, with 22 of their first 25 games against teams that had winning records last season. They will play five of their first seven at home, with the Cavs and Sixers venturing across the border this week.

It’s Year 2 for Victor Wembanyama and Year 20 for Chris Paul, who almost always makes teams better when he first puts on their uniform. But it could be a tough climb for the Spurs in a deep Western Conference.
Preseason takeaways

Devin Vassell (right foot surgery) has been out and will miss the start of the regular season, with Julian Champagnie appearing to be his replacement in the starting lineup. He can’t replicate Vassell’s skills off the dribble (he made seven pull-up jumpers all of last season), but Champagnie shot 16-for-38 (42%) from beyond the arc in the preseason.


The Spurs (who ranked 13th in total zone possessions last season) played the second most zone in the preseason, according to Synergy tracking. Zone, of course, is a way to keep Wembanyama near the basket … on defense, at least.

Something to watch in Week 1: Wembanyama’s shots. In the preseason, the 7-foot-3 guy took only nine (43%) of his 21 shots in the paint, at least in part because he settled for jumpers instead of attacking the basket. Last season, that rate was 51%, which is still too low. He’s 7-foot-3! Get him the ball near the hoop.
The Spurs were 1-7 in games played between the three Texas teams last season, and they’ll begin this one with three games against the Mavs and Rockets (x 2), with a rest advantage against Houston on Saturday.

It’s another fresh start for the Pistons, who’ve been the league’s worst team over the last five seasons. It also feels like a huge season for Cade Cunningham, even though he got a max extension early in the summer.
Preseason takeaways

Cunningham was just 3-for-13 on 3-pointers, but his mid-range game looked sharp. He drained three straight pull-ups at one point in the Pistons’ win in Phoenix and finished 8-for-14 from between the paint and the 3-point line.


The Pistons scored an efficient 120.1 points per 100 possessions in Cunningham’s 71 minutes alongside Jaden Ivey, who had the highest effective field goal percentage (71.6%) among 115 players with at least 35 field goal attempts. It may not be a coincidence that Isaiah Stewart and Jalen Duren (who played 745 minutes together last season) didn’t play a second together in the preseason.

Something to watch in Week 1: Tobias Harris looking to score. The last we saw Harris in games that counted, he was registering an anemic usage rate of 11.8% in the playoffs. His presence makes the Pistons more legit, but they need him to regain his desire to put the ball in the basket.
The Pistons are playing 23 or 24 of their first 27 games within the Eastern Conference and their first six (all against 2024 playoff teams) should be one of their toughest stretches of the season. They were 0-30 against the eight East playoff teams last season.

DeMar DeRozan is gone and he took his mid-range shots with him. It’s not clear how competitive the Bulls will be, but their shot diet could be a lot different.
Preseason takeaways

Historically, there’s a stronger correlation from the preseason to the regular season when it comes to style-of-play stats than when it comes to quality-of-play stats. And the Bulls’ preseason stats indicate that things will be different this year. They saw both the league’s biggest jump in pace and it’s biggest jump in 3-point rate (3PA/FGA) from last season to the preseason, with eleven different Bulls attempting at least 10 3s over their five games.


Lonzo Ball is back after a 33-month absence, he played most of his 31 minutes alongside the Bulls’ returning starters, and he looked pretty good in totaling 21 points and four assists. Both he and Josh Giddey will get the Bulls in transition, though it will be interesting to see how much they play together.

Something to watch in Week 1: 3-point differential. The Bulls were outscored by 9.3 points per game from beyond the arc last season, with that being the league’s biggest discrepancy. Part of that was how few 3s they attempted, and part of it was how many they allowed.
After playing their first two games on the road, the Bulls will alternate home and road games for almost three weeks. They’ve lost 25 of their last 30 games against the Bucks, who they’ll visit on Friday.

Lauri Markkanen remains in Utah with a new contract, but there’s probably not enough experienced talent around him for the Jazz to compete in the Western Conference.
Preseason takeaways

The Jazz are back to playing big, with Taylor Hendricks and Walker Kessler joining Markkanen on the starting frontline. The 20-year-old Hendricks took 23 (61%) of his 38 shots from beyond the arc and connected on just six (26%) of the 23, but the Jazz grabbed a pretty amazing 42.6% of available offensive rebounds with that trio on the floor.


The ball is in the hands of 20-year-old Keyonte George, who can sometimes venture too far into “get mine” territory. He shot well (effective field goal percentage of 64.0%), but had a lower assist ratio in the preseason (19.2% of his possessions) than last season (23.3%).

Something to watch in Week 1: Turnovers. The Jazz committed 3.4 more turnovers than their opponents last season, with that being the third-worst differential for any team in the last 20 years. Their own turnovers, of course, contributed to the 27.2 transition points per game (second most in 20 years of Synergy tracking) they allowed. Not ranking 30th on defense starts in transition, and transition defense starts with not ranking 30th in turnover rate (which they did in the preseason too).
The Jazz’s first opponent (Memphis) ranked third in opponent turnover rate last season, with the Jazz committing 16 more turnovers (5.3 per game) over their three meetings.

There are a few teams that could tell us how much of a difference a coaching change can make. The Hornets are one of them, with Charles Lee taking over a roster that didn’t go through many changes in the offseason.
Preseason takeaways

LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller combined to shoot 36-for-79 (45.6%) from 3-point range, with those 79 attempts accounting for 69% of their total shots from the field. Overall, the Hornets saw the league’s second biggest jump in 3-point rate (3PA/FGA) from last season to the preseason (49.3%, second), with Lee’s new team only trailing his old one.


Mark Williams suffered a strained tendon in his left foot before training camp and missed all five preseason games, leaving his status for the start of the regular season unknown. Ball, Miller and Williams played just 153 total minutes together last season, with the Hornets outscoring their opponents by 5.4 points per 100 possession in those minutes.

Something to watch in Week 1: Tidjane Salaün’s minutes. The No. 6 pick in the Draft only started one of the Hornets’ five games but ranked fourth (among all players) in total preseason minutes (139). How much he plays when the games count could tell us how competitive the Hornets (who have some solid vets at the forward positions) want to be.
After the Hornets open the season in Houston, they’ll play (depending on the unscheduled week) 25 or 26 of their next 27 games within the Eastern Conference. They’ll be at a rest disadvantage in their home opener against Miami on Saturday, having lost 11 of their last 13 games vs. the Heat.

If the Blazers want to get this thing moving in the right direction, they’re going to have a tough time in a loaded Western Conference. But there are a lot of young players for which this will be a critical season, no matter how many wins the team tallies.
Preseason takeaways

Even when you throw out their win over Ratiopharm Ulm, the Blazers were, statistically, the best team in the preseason. Their other two wins were blowouts over the (basically) full-strength Kings and Jazz, outscoring Sacramento by 20 points in Domantas Sabonis’ 30 minutes and Utah by 13 points in Lauri Markkanen’s 17 minutes. (Portland was 0-11 against NBA opponents in Chauncey Billups’ first three preseasons as coach.)


Donovan Clingan ranked second in rebounding percentage (24.0%) among 322 players who averaged at least 15 minutes in two games or more. He also showed some pretty good vision as he registered 14 points, 20 rebounds, four assists and four blocks (in just 24 minutes) against the Jazz on Friday. A 7-foot-2 guy who can see the floor and pass effectively can be a real weapon.

Something to watch in Week 1: Scoot Henderson, Year 2. Even with Shaedon Sharpe (shoulder injury) out to start the season, it appears that Henderson will come off the bench again. He can be a solid playmaker, but he needs to put the ball in the basket, and his preseason shooting (effective field goal percentage of 40.2%) wasn’t encouraging.
The Blazers were 7-46 (third worst) against the 18 teams that finished with winning records last season. Their first eight games are against that group, and their first stretch of five games in seven days begins Sunday with their second game against the Pelicans.

When the Nets traded Mikal Bridges, they also traded for their own first-round pick. So we can see where this season is probably going. But there’s a measure of intrigue with a new coach and the potential to develop some young talent like they did the last time they were in this position (without their own picks).
Preseason takeaways

Cam Thomas ranked third on the team in usage rate (22.4%), and he was assisted on 12 (67%) of his 18 field goals. He’s been assisted on just 46% of his regular-season buckets in his career.


Ben Simmons played 52 minutes over three games, often operating at the five, with the Nets playing the entire preseason without Nic Claxton (who’s expected to be available on Wednesday) and Day’Ron Sharpe (out at least another four weeks). Simmons, of course, didn’t attempt a single shot from outside the paint. But he can get the Nets in transition and reward teammates for moving without the ball.

Something to watch in Week 1: Defensive buy-in. The Nets have a group of good defenders, but they rarely displayed a desire to compete on that end of the floor last season. Maybe new head coach Jordi Fernandez can elicit better effort.
The team that scored most efficiently against Brooklyn last season (129.8 points per 100 possessions over three games) was the Bucks, who the Nets will host on Sunday.

The Wizards were 15-67 last season, and the two most efficient starters from that team are gone.
Preseason takeaways

With Tyus Jones in Phoenix, Jordan Poole is the starting point guard in Washington. Poole’s assist ratio (22.5 per 100 possessions used) was the highest he’s recorded in any regular season or preseason prior, but still nothing close to Jones’ ratio of 39.3 last season. Malcolm Brogdon is here, but is dealing with a thumb injury (after playing just 39 games for Portland last season).


The Wizards’ expected starting lineup — Poole, Bilal Coulibaly, Kyle Kuzma, Alexandre Sarr and Jonas Valančiūnas — did not have a great preseason, getting outscored by 27 points in 29 total minutes against the Raptors and Knicks. They started rookie Kyshawn George instead of Valančiūnas in their second game against Toronto, but scored just three points on their first 13 possessions, often looking unorganized offensively.

Something to watch in Week 1: Defensive activity. While the offense was a serious struggle, you can see some defensive potential in the young (and long) trio of Coulibaly, George and Sarr. It’s doubtful that the Wizards will break their streak of three straight seasons in the bottom 10 on defense, but the young guys might force some turnovers that lead to transition opportunities.
The Wizards will begin their season on Thursday against the league’s No. 1 offense from last season, having lost eight of their last nine against Boston. They’ll have a rest advantage two nights later against the Cavs.

OffRtg: 112.5 (15) DefRtg: 95.1 (1) NetRtg: +17.4 (2) Pace: 102.4 (6)
The Thunder aren’t just 6-0. They’re also the only team that hasn’t played a game that was within five points in the last five minutes. So all six wins have been comfortable.
Three takeaways

The Thunder have six comfortable wins despite ranking just 15th offensively. In five of their six games, they’ve held their opponent to at least 13 fewer points per 100 possessions than that team has scored in other games this season. (i.e. the Clippers scored 110.5 per 100 through their first five games, but were held to 92.0 per 100 on Saturday.)


The one exception was their win in Portland on Friday, when the Thunder scored 137 points on 100 possessions (the third most efficient performance for any team this season), with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander shooting 11-for-12 inside the arc. The Kia MVP candidate is just 12-for-43 (28%) from 3-point range, with the Thunder (who led the league last season) ranking 20th as a team.


Though the Thunder haven’t had any injury absences (beyond Isaiah Hartenstein and a pair of less-consequential Williams), they don’t have a lineup that’s played more than 34 minutes. That’s because they’ve changed the fifth starter every game, with Isaiah Joe, Cason Wallace and Aaron Wiggins each getting two starts. Alex Caruso continues to come off the bench, though the Thunder have outscored their opponents by an amazing 59 points (43.9 per 100 possessions) in his 65 minutes alongside Gilgeous-Alexander.

The Thunder are back in Denver (where they opened the season with a win) on Wednesday. They’ll then begin their longest homestand of the season, with all six games against Western Conference teams that finished at or above .500 last season.

OffRtg: 121.9 (2) DefRtg: 107.7 (5) NetRtg: +14.3 (3) Pace: 100.9 (11)
The Cavs remain perfect, though they needed a tough shot from Donovan Mitchell to escape from Milwaukee with victory No. 7 on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Cavs’ starting lineup (with Dean Wade in place of the injured Max Strus) has averaged less than 10 minutes per game and has outscored opponents by just 1.8 points per 100 possessions. Bench minutes continue to be terrific, in part because reserves are usually on the floor with a combination of two starters. The Cavs’ big win in New York on Monday came with a 25-8 run spanning the third and fourth quarters.


Even with Caris LeVert out on Saturday, the Cavs won a game in which the starting lineup was outscored by 13 points in a little over 11 minutes. Sam Merrill played a big role, scoring a season-high 17 points in 22 minutes. Merrill (92.1%) and Wade (80.5%) are two of the five players who’ve taken at least 25 shots this season with more than 80% of those shots coming from 3-point range.


The Cavs also committed six fewer turnovers (7-13) than Milwaukee. They rank third in turnover differential (-4.4 per game), having seen the league’s biggest drop in turnover rate and its fourth biggest jump in opponent turnover rate.

The Cavs will face the Bucks again on Monday, this time in Cleveland. With a win, they’d be the first team since the 2015-16 Warriors to start 8-0 with an average point differential of at least 10 points.

Two nights after missing 38 triples in the Indiana loss, the Celtics took less than half of their shots from beyond the arc for the first time this season. With Al Horford out in Charlotte on Friday, they had two rotation guys — Luke Kornet and Neemias Queta — who don’t shoot 3s, and they scored a season-high 56 points in the paint.


They got outscored from 3-point range in both of their weekend games in Charlotte, but were a +42 at the free-throw line. Jayson Tatum is just 10-for-44 (23%) from deep over the last four games, but he’s 37-for-45 from the stripe over the last three. That takes his free-throw rate to 47 attempts per 100 shots from the field, easily the highest rate of his career and up from 35 per 100 last season. With improved shooting inside the arc, his overall efficiency (true shooting percentage of 63.2%) is also a career-high mark, despite the long-range struggles.


Kornet was still in the starting lineup on Saturday, because Jaylen Brown was out with a hip flexor strain. The Celtics have won the last 15 games (going back to late in the 2022-23 season) that Brown has missed.

Brown will be out again when the Celtics conclude their four-game trip in Atlanta on Monday. That will be their third rest-advantage game of the season thus far.

After splitting their first two games in L.A., the Suns have won four straight and are one of five teams with fewer than two losses.
Three takeaways

It really looked like the Suns were putting last season’s fourth-quarter issues behind them. They came back from seven down in the fourth to beat the Lakers on Monday (getting 10 straight points from Kevin Durant) and completed another big comeback against the Clippers with a 34-26 fourth quarter (featuring a pretty screen, roll and kick from Devin Booker) three nights later.


But after a 44-18 third quarter against the Blazers on Saturday, they let the visitors cut a 26-point, fourth-quarter lead down to two, with Dalano Banton’s 3-pointer for the lead spinning in and out with about 30 seconds left. Overall, the Suns are in the middle of the pack (minus 0.1 points per 100 possessions) in the fourth quarter, and if they’re inconsistent in the final 12 minutes of regulation, that’s still much better than what they were last season.


That Booker assist against the Clippers was to Royce O’Neale, who continues to be a closer for the Suns. Phoenix is 4-0 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes. Sometimes that’s in place of Jusuf Nurkić, though the numbers have been great (plus-28 per 100 possessions) in 88 total minutes with Durant and O’Neale on the floor with either Nurkić or Mason Plumlee.

The Suns tip off the Eastern Conference portion of their schedule with games against Philadelphia and Miami. They were 12-3 in home games against the Eastern Conference last season, though they lost the first two.

The Warriors are 3-0 without Stephen Curry, having scored more efficiently in the three games (119.9 points per 100 possessions) than they did in the three games he played (117.4 per 100).
Three takeaways

Buddy Hield was 1-for-9 from 3-point range in the Warriors’ one loss, but has shot 29-for-49 (59%) from deep in their five wins. He’s averaging a team-high 22.2 points in only 25.4 minutes (as the Warriors continue to play more than 10 guys every night), with his 31.4 points per 36 being the most he’s averaged in his career (by a huge margin) and up from 16.9 per 36 last season.


Jonathan Kuminga has taken well to coming off the bench, averaging 18.7 points on a true shooting percentage of 61.7% over the last three games, up from 8.0 on 41% in his three games as a starter. It’s helped that a higher percentage of his shots (73% vs. 58%) have come in the paint.


The Warriors have been at their best on defense, ranking second in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (49.5%) and first in opponent effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint (44%). It should be noted that their first five games came against teams that currently rank in the bottom 11 offensively, with their overtime win over the 11th-ranked Rockets (in which they blew a 31-point lead) on Saturday being the first time they’ve allowed more points per 100 possessions than the league average.

Curry is listed as questionable for Monday, when the Warriors’ five-game trip continues in Washington. The last three games — at Boston, Cleveland and Oklahoma City — will be the biggest tests of their season so far and probably their toughest three-game stretch of the entire season.

The Knicks went 2-2 as they played their first four games against 2024 East playoff teams, then clobbered the Pistons on Friday.
Three takeaways

Karl-Anthony Towns scored 44 points in the Knicks’ win in Miami, capping the performance with a couple of buckets against former teammate Jimmy Butler. Towns was 4-for-5 from 3-point range on Wednesday and 11-for-17 (65%) from deep for the season, but he’s taken 62% of his shots in the paint, with that being his highest rate in the last eight seasons.


After Towns’ 44 in Miami, Jalen Brunson had 36 (shooting 6-for-8 from deep) in Detroit. The Knicks have scored a remarkable 1.7 points per direct possession (action leads directly to a shot, turnover or trip to the line) when Towns has set a ball screen for Brunson (39 possessions total).


Josh Hart left the loss to Cleveland on Monday with a shin contusion. Two nights later, he was listed as questionable … and played more than 42 minutes in Miami. Over their five games, the Knicks have been at their worst (minus 6.1 points per 100 possessions) with Hart off the floor.

Having scored more than 126 points per 100 possessions over the first two games of the trip, the Knicks will now visit the team (Houston) that ranks 11th defensively. Then they’ll play four straight games against teams that currently rank in the bottom 10 on that end of the floor.

The Mavs haven’t haven’t hit their stride (especially offensively) yet, but they went 3-1 last week, with a big rest-disadvantage win in Minnesota included.
Three takeaways

It’s certainly too early to really believe in the Mavs as a top-10 defensive team, as their numbers have been buoyed by games against the Spurs (who rank 27th offensively), Jazz (30th) and Magic (25th and without Paolo Banchero). They’ve allowed more than 117 points per 100 possessions over their other three games.


One of those other three was Tuesday, when the Wolves registered an effective field goal percentage of 63.0%, the highest mark for a losing team so far this season. The Mavs countered that by committing 10 fewer turnovers (10-20), and they got big 3s from both of their star guards down the stretch to get their fourth straight win in Minnesota (going back to Game 1 of the conference finals).


Luka Dončić is registering a career-low mark for effective field goal percentage (46.9%), having seen big drop-offs both in and outside the paint. But he still scored 32 points in less than 32 minutes against the Magic (who have a top 10 defense) on Sunday.

The Mavs’ five-game homestand (their longest of the season) concludes on Friday with their second of four meetings with the Suns. The first (a 12-point loss in Phoenix) was the Mavs’ worst offensive game of the season thus far (102 points on 98 possessions), even though Dončić scored 40 points in less than 40 minutes.

After a 3-0 homestand to start the season, the Lakers hit the road and took two losses before their offense recovered in Toronto on Friday.
Three takeaways

For the third straight season, the Lakers lead the league in free-throw differential, having outscored their opponents by 9.5 points per game at the line, what would be the largest differential in NBA history. Anthony Davis may have just two 3-pointers in six games, but his free-throw rate (60 attempts per 100 shots from the field) is the highest of his 13-year career by a huge margin. Austin Reaves (12-for-14) outscored the Raptors (11-for-13) at the line by himself on Friday.


The Lakers rank 27th defensively, having seen the third biggest jump in points allowed per 100 possessions. And it’s not about 3-point shooting, with their opponents having shot just 35.5% from beyond the arc (down from 37.6% last season). It’s more about the interior, with their opponents having shot 62.9% in the paint, the league’s second worst mark and by far the Lakers’ worst mark in Davis’ six seasons in L.A. And it hasn’t been much lower with Davis on the floor (62.4%) than it’s been with him on the bench (64.4%).


Last season, the Lakers had the worst point differential (+0.6 points per game) among the 18 teams that finished with winning records. This season is the same, with L.A. having been outscored by four points over its six games. All four wins have been by seven points or fewer.

Regarding the defense, the Lakers have played six teams currently ranked no lower than 16th offensively (and that 16th-ranked team is the Suns). They’ll face two bottom-eight offenses this week, visiting the Pistons (with a rest advantage) on Monday and hosting the Sixers (who may be a lot more potent than they’ve been so far) four nights later.

The Wolves got a big win over the Nuggets on Friday, rallying from 10 points down with less than four minutes to go. But that was sandwiched by losses to the Mavs and Spurs in which they allowed more than 120 points per 100 possessions.
Three takeaways

After last season, the Wolves had nowhere to go but down regarding where they rank defensively, and they’ve seen the league’s biggest jump in points allowed per 100 possessions. Their opponents haven’t shot better from 3-point range, but they’ve shot much better in the paint (59% vs. 53% last season) and the Wolves have also seen the league’s second-biggest drop in opponent turnover rate.


The defense has been much better (109.6 points allowed per 100 possessions) with Rudy Gobert on the floor, but the starting lineup has not been great (minus 7.1 per 100) overall. The Wolves have been an amazing 39.4 points per 100 possessions better with Nickeil Alexander-Walker on the floor (plus 19.3 per 100) than they have with him off the floor (minus 20.1 per 100).


The starting lineup’s issues aren’t about Julius Randle’s efficiency. Randle has a true shooting percentage of 69.8%, the fifth-best mark among 139 players with at least 50 field goal attempts, one spot behind teammate Naz Reid (70.6%) and three spots ahead of the guy (Karl-Anthony Towns) he was traded for (68%).

After an 0-2 start, the Nuggets have won three out of four, getting their first comfortable victory (and their first home win) by beating the Jazz on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Given the issues with their bench and who the opponents were (Toronto and Brooklyn), the Nuggets probably didn’t want to go to overtime in both games of their first back-to-back, with Nikola Jokić logging a total of 84 minutes. But they picked up their first two wins, having trailed each game by at least 15 points and benefitting from missed free throws down the stretch of both.


Bench minutes were slightly better last week, though still not great. The Nuggets’ lineup with Michael Porter Jr. as the only starter — which Denver tried last week — was outscored by 28 points in 21 total minutes. It included Dario Šarić, who wasn’t in the rotation against Utah on Saturday.


With Jamal Murray out on Saturday, Russell Westbrook was in the starting lineup. He shot just 2-for-11 and has the worst effective field goal percentage (35.9%) among 139 players with at least 50 field goal attempts, but Julian Strawther had his best game (19 points on 7-for-11 shooting) off the bench in the 26-point win over the Jazz.

The Nuggets’ five-game homestand continues this week and big tests against the Thunder and Mavs await. Their season-opening loss to Oklahoma City (also at home) was their least efficient regular-season offensive performance (87 points on 99 possessions) in the last seven seasons.

The Grizzlies continue to deal with injuries, losing Desmond Bane and Marcus Smart in their loss to Brooklyn on Wednesday. But they climbed back above .500 by holding the Bucks and Sixers to 102 points per 100 possessions later in the week.
Three takeaways

Last season, the Grizzlies were the only team without a five-man group that played at least 100 minutes together. This season, they’re the only team without one that’s played at least 20 minutes together. Their projected starters are stuck at 11 minutes and they continue to go deep on their bench.


With Bane and Smart out, Ja Morant and Scotty Pippen Jr. played 24 total minutes together over the last two games, with the Grizzlies outscoring their opponents by 28 points in those 24 minutes. Part of that was the opponents (Milwaukee and Philadelphia) shooting 6-for-24 from 3-point range, but the offense was also super efficient. On Thursday, Morant had a triple-double less than five minutes into the second half. Two nights later, the two point guards combined for 25 assists.


The Grizzlies have outscored their opponents by a league-best 14.0 points per game in the restricted area, with their biggest differential (+32) coming in Philly on Saturday when the Sixers shot just 11-for-27 in the restricted area.

The Grizzlies had a rest advantage when they lost to the Nets last week, and they’ll have another rest advantage in Brooklyn on Monday. Then they’ll return home to face the team (the Lakers) that led the league in restricted-area differential last season.

The Mexico City Game on Saturday was a wire-to-wire victory and marked the first time the Heat weren’t outscored with their starting lineup on the floor. Overall, the lineup has been outscored by 15.7 points per 100 possessions, the second-worst mark among 19 lineups that have played at least 50 minutes.


They still had all five starters on the floor when they were within four points late in their loss to the Knicks on Wednesday. And really, the presence of Nikola Jović in the lineup hasn’t been the issue. The Heat have also been outscored by seven points (allowing 54 on 41 defensive possessions) in 20 minutes with the other four starters on the floor without Jović.


Bam Adebayo is 0-for-8 from 3-point range in the United States (going 0-for-2 in each of the Heat’s first four games), but was 3-for-5 from beyond the arc as he scored a game-high 32 points in their win over Washington in Mexico City. The 13 attempts account for 21% of his total shots, up from 2% through his first seven seasons in the league.

The Heat are back from Mexico City for just one game (Monday vs. the Kings). They then begin their first of two six-game road trips, and the Western Conference half of this one — at Phoenix, Denver and Minnesota — is a doozy.

The Kings recovered from an 0-2 start and won three straight games before losing in overtime in Toronto on Saturday.
Three takeaways

We got a taste of the late-game prowess of De’Aaron Fox and DeMar DeRozan on Friday when the duo hit three straight pull-up 2-pointers to turn a tie game in Atlanta into a six-point lead with a little less than five minutes left. The following night in Toronto, Fox and DeRozan scored 20 of the Kings’ 22 points as they rallied from 13 down late in the fourth quarter. But while they’re a combined 8-for-14 on clutch 2-pointers and 8-for-8 on clutch free throws, they’re 2-for-10 on clutch 3s, missing three of them for the tie in the final 20 seconds of overtime on Saturday.


With the addition of DeRozan (who already has 11 more mid-range attempts than any other player), the Kings have gone from third in 3-point rate (43.2% of their shots) last season to 21st (39.8%) this season. They were a plus-30 from beyond the arc against Portland on Monday, but have been outscored by at least 18 points from deep in four of their six games (including each of the last three).


Having lost three games by four points or fewer, the Kings have the league’s biggest discrepancy between their point differential and their record. Their three most-used lineups have outscored their opponents by 92 points (31.7 per 100 possessions) in 131 total minutes.

One of the five teams with a worse 3-point differential than Sacramento (-9.5 points per game) is the Clippers (-12.5), who the Kings will host on Friday. Before that, they’ll get a chance to avenge their loss to Toronto.

Two days after scoring 50 points (and generating Anthony Black’s game-winning 3-pointer) against the Pacers, Paolo Banchero suffered a torn oblique muscle that will have him out for at least a month.
Three takeaways

The Magic weren’t a very good offensive team with Banchero in uniform, and without him, offense will be a real struggle. Their loss in Dallas on Sunday was the third-worst offensive game (85 points on 101 possessions) for any team this season and they’ve now scored just 96 points per 100 possessions in 154 total minutes with Banchero off the floor.


It was just a single possession, but Jalen Suggs being unable to generate a good shot with the Magic down two in Chicago on Wednesday was a decent illustration of their offensive issues without their star. After blowing a 20-point lead, the Magic scored just 10 points on 13 clutch possessions in the loss.


Tristan da Silva scored 17 points on 6-for-8 shooting off the bench in Cleveland on Friday and was rewarded with his first career start two nights later in Dallas. A 23-year-old rookie, da Silva already has some polish to his game and seems comfortable shooting from beyond the arc, though it’s unclear if he can do much off the dribble.

The team that the Celtics swept in the Eastern Conference Finals is the team that handed Boston its first loss of the season (after blowing a 21-point, fourth-quarter lead). But the Pacers are 1-4 outside that win over the champs, and they’ve already lost two big men (James Wiseman and Isaiah Jackson) to torn Achilles.
Three takeaways

The overtime win over the Celtics was not the Pacers’ best offensive game, but (with Jackson starting in place of Myles Turner) they held Boston to just 22-for-47 (47%) shooting in the paint, what would have been their lowest single-game opponent mark all of last season.


Pascal Siakam bailed his team out after it blew that 21-point, fourth-quarter lead, hitting a turnaround jumper to tie the game in OT and then a 3-pointer to win it. Each of the Pacers’ last four games has been within five points in the last five minutes, and (even with the Siakam heroics) they’ve scored just 46 points on 50 clutch possessions over that stretch.


According to Synergy tracking, the Pacers have already played more possessions of zone defense (14, including a few in all three games last week) than they did all of last season when they were the only team to play less than 10 possessions of zone. The increased use of zone may go along with a general aim of protecting the paint better than they did last season.

The Pacers’ visit to Dallas on Monday will be their first of 10 rest-advantage games. Two nights later, they’ll host the Magic without the guy (Paolo Banchero) who dropped 50 on ’em last week.

Each of the Clippers’ first five games were within five points in the last five minutes, and they had a six-point, second-half lead against the Thunder (the only team that hasn’t played a clutch game) on Saturday. But they were then outscored by 24 points (38-14) over the next 15 minutes.


The Clippers have led all six of their games by double-digits. They’ve outscored their opponents by 24.1 points per 100 possessions (only the Celtics have been better) in the first quarter, but have been outscored by 8.9 per 100 thereafter. (Some of that is just opponent 3-point shooting: 33% in the first vs. 42% otherwise.) So while they were 44-7 (tied for sixth best) when leading by double-digits last season, they already have four losses this year.


Norman Powell has adjusted just fine to starting games on the floor instead of on the bench, averaging 25.2 points with a true shooting percentage of 64.1%. That’s third among the 20 players averaging 25 points or more, trailing only the marks of Nikola Jokić and Anthony Davis. James Harden’s 23 assists to Powell are the most from any player to a single teammate.

The Spurs have won two straight games, getting their best victory of the early season on Saturday, when they knocked off the Wolves with a big second half.
Three takeaways

The Wolves were the league’s best defensive team by a wide margin last season. But the win on Saturday, was the Spurs’ best offensive game (113 points on 96 possessions) thus far. And that was more about their shooting in the paint (26-for-34) than their shooting from beyond the arc (13-for-42), even though the 13 3s were a season high. Overall, the Spurs are one of two teams – the Pelicans are the other – that rank in the bottom 10 in three of the four factors on offense.


As the Spurs began the season 1-3, they were outscored by 18.9 points per 100 possessions with Chris Paul on the floor. But over their wins against Utah and Minnesota, Paul was a plus-49, totaling 34 points (on 13-for-22 shooting) and 23 assists (with just two turnovers). The 39-year old has taken 60% of his shots from 3-point range, easily the highest rate of his career.


Victor Wembanyama’s Defensive Player of the Year candidacy will depend, at least partially, on where the Spurs rank as a team on that end of the floor. Through two weeks, they rank fourth, having allowed 18.9 fewer points per 100 possessions with Wembanyama on the floor (99.2) than they have with him off the floor (118.1).

They’ll play three teams that rank in the bottom seven offensively this week, with the exception being their visit to Houston on Wednesday, their third meeting with the Rockets.

The Pelicans managed to get a win over the Pacers on Friday, but have lost four of their last five games, mostly because they’ve had only one or two of their top six guys available for the last three.
Three takeaways

The Pelicans scored just 89 points on 94 possessions in their second of back-to-back losses at Golden State, but the other end of the floor has been the larger issue. They’ve allowed 123.9 points per 100 possessions over this 1-4 stretch, what would have been their worst five-game stretch of defense all last season.


The defensive drop-off has come both inside and out. They’ve seen the league’s third-biggest jump in opponent 3-point percentage, its biggest jump in the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come in the paint, and its fourth-biggest drop in defensive rebounding percentage.


Brandon Ingram, the only one of the top six guys who’s played every game, can still take (and make) some tough mid-range shots. But he’s also a more willing 3-point shooter than he’s been in the past, shooting 42% on a career-high 6.4 attempts per game. That should allow him to better complement Zion Williamson and the Pelicans’ other ball-handlers (when they’re healthy).

The Pelicans have both the fewest rest-advantage games (4) and the fewest rest-disadvantage games (6) in the league this season. The first of the latter is Monday, their third meeting with the Blazers and the third game of their four-game homestand.

With their win over the Magic on Wednesday, the Bulls were over .500 for the first time in almost two years (since Nov. 4, 2022). But their time amongst the winning lasted less than 48 hours.
Three takeaways

The Bulls have been outscored by 26.1 points per 100 possessions in the first quarter and have trailed five of their six games by more than 15 points. But they came back from 20 down in Memphis on Monday and again against Orlando two nights later. Last season, they were one of three teams with a league-high three wins after trailing by 20-plus, and they’ve already got two this year.


They erased a 17-point deficit in Brooklyn on Friday, when they outscored the Nets by 18 points (51-33) from 3-point range. But they came up short offensively down the stretch and got destroyed in the paint. The Bulls have been outscored by at least 34 points from 2-point range in three of their last four games.


Even though Josh Giddey was shooting 10-for-17 from 3-point range before he went 0-for-4 on Saturday, the Bulls’ starting lineup has scored just 93.2 points per 100 possessions, the worst mark among the 19 lineups that have played at least 50 minutes. That includes just 65 points on 79 possessions (82 per 100) in the first quarter.

The Bulls will have a pretty good chance to get back over .500 when they host the Jazz on Monday. They’ve won four straight against Utah and scored almost 128 points per 100 possessions over their two wins last season.

The Hawks lost four straight games, including two against the Wizards over which the opponent shot 45% from 3-point range. But the streak came to an end in New Orleans, with the Hawks doubling up the Pelicans (66-32) in the paint.
Three takeaways

The Hawks have been dealing with injuries to four guards/wings, and De’Andre Hunter’s absence has had Zaccharie Risacher in the starting lineup for the last five games. The No. 1 pick had 17 points, six rebounds and two blocks in Washington on Wednesday, but his effective field goal percentage (36.4%) is the third lowest mark among 139 players with at least 50 field goal attempts.


Trae Young has basically played half of his minutes with the rookie. The Hawks have been outscored by 11.6 points per 100 possessions in 133 minutes with the two on the floor together, but are a plus-11.1 per 100 in 132 minutes with Young on the floor without Risacher.


Jalen Johnson scored a career-high 29 points in the first of the Hawks’ two losses to the Wizards. Then he matched it in their win in New Orleans on Sunday. The 22-year old has been handling the ball a lot more and has seen a huge drop in effective field goal percentage (47.6%) from last season (56.2%), though he’s also seen a big jump in free throw rate.

The Hawks’ win in New Orleans was the start of their first stretch of five games in seven days, and their rest-disadvantage game against the Celtics on Monday is the first of two meetings in the next nine. The home team won all four meetings between Atlanta and Boston last season.

New coach Jordi Fernandez has the Nets playing with more juice than last season. After dropping their first two games, they won three of four, with the only loss coming against Denver in overtime.
Three takeaways

The Nets scored 121.7 points per 100 possessions over that 3-1 stretch, with Cam Thomas and Dennis Schröder combining to average 52 points on a true shooting percentage of 65%. Schröder was on fire from 3-point range, while Thomas was 35-for-38 from the line over the four games.


This team is looking more competitive than expected, but being consistently competitive might be a level it can’t reach. The offense cooled off on Sunday afternoon when the Nets scored just 92 points on 93 possessions in a double-digit loss to the Pistons (who came into Brooklyn ranking 23rd defensively). Thomas didn’t get to the basket or the line much, and if he’s not cooking, there probably aren’t enough sources of offense elsewhere.


Dorian Finney-Smith could be in the last year of his contract (he has a player option for next season) and is likely on the radar of contending teams who might need another forward for the stretch run. But he’ll need to make open corner 3s for whatever team he’s playing on in the Spring and he’s just 3-for-17 from the corners thus far, missing a wide-open look for the win against Denver on Tuesday.

The Nets’ first stretch of five games in seven days ends with a visit from the Grizzlies on Monday. But after three days off, they’ll begin what is likely their toughest stretch of the season, six games (five on the road) that include two meetings each with the Celtics and Knicks, as well as a visit to Cleveland on Saturday night.

The Hornets were somewhat competitive in two games against the Celtics over the weekend, but couldn’t come all the way back from two bad starts.
Three takeaways

The two games against the champs were the second and third times that the Hornets have lost the first quarter by at least 12 points. They’ve scored more than a point per possession in the first quarter in only one of their six games, but have scored more than 130 points per 100 in the fourth quarter in five of the six.


Their loss to the Celtics on Saturday was the first time that the Hornets committed fewer turnovers (13-15) than their opponents (they had committed 27 more through their first five games). LaMelo Ball is registering career-high marks for both 2-point percentage (55.9%) and 3-point percentage (40.5%), but has an assist/turnover ratio of just 1.15, down from 2.27 over his first four seasons.


Brandon Miller returned from a four-game absence on Saturday, the first time the Hornets had Ball, Miller, Josh Green and Miles Bridges in the lineup together. But center Mark Williams remains out (he doesn’t seem close to a return) and Nick Richards missed the Saturday loss with a shoulder issue, leaving Grant Williams to start at the five against his old team and less than 24 hours after being ejected for a flagrant 2 foul on Jayson Tatum.

The Hornets don’t play the Celtics again until the last two games of the season, and they now have a one-game trip to Minnesota, where they won (despite 62 points from Karl-Anthony Towns) in January.

The Raptors had RJ Barrett in the lineup for the first time on Monday, only to lose Scottie Barnes for a few weeks when he took an elbow in the face.
Three takeaways

The Raptors blew double-digit, fourth-quarter leads against both the Nuggets and Kings last week, eventually splitting the two games that went to overtime. But the starts of games have been a much bigger problem than the finishes. They’ve been outscored by 25.9 points per 100 possessions in the first quarter, falling into a 26-point hole against the Lakers on Friday.


Gradey Dick already has as many 20-point games (four) as he did all of last season, when three of those four came in the Raptors’ last 13 games. He had a career-high 30 in Charlotte on Wednesday and then topped that (with 31) against the Lakers two nights later. He’s 22-for-36 (61%) on 2-pointers outside the restricted area, with the biggest of the 22 being his late-clock floater for a 3-point lead with 20 seconds left in overtime on Saturday.


The clutch defense has been, statistically, worse than the first-quarter defense. The Raptors allowed 51 points on 37 clutch defensive possessions (1.38 per) last week, with Jakob Pöltl getting beat by Jamal Murray and LaMelo Ball on big drives late in their losses to the Nuggets and Hornets.

The Raptors will play 10 of their next 13 games on the road. After a 4-1 start, they lost their last 10 games in Western Conference arenas last season, also dropping their first (in Minnesota) this year.

After losing their first four games, the Pistons have won two of three, holding both the Sixers and Nets under 105 points per 100 possessions. The win over Philly ended a 34-game losing streak against the eight Eastern Conference teams that made the playoffs last season.
Three takeaways

The Pistons might be pretty good if they could take care of the ball and/or force a few turnovers on the other end of the floor. On opening night, they committed one fewer turnover than the Pacers. Since then, they’ve committed at least five more than each of their six opponents, racking up a total differential of +44 turnovers over those six games.


They’ve mitigated the turnover issue somewhat by being the only team that ranks in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive rebounding percentage. Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart (who haven’t played together this season) rank first and 16th in individual rebounding percentage among 246 players who’ve averaged at least 15 minutes per game.


Cade Cunningham has averaged 5.1 turnovers per game (third most) and has an assist/turnover ratio of just 1.33, down from 2.19 last season. But the Pistons have scored just 98.3 points per 100 possessions in 85 minutes with Cunningham off the floor. They’re using Jaden Ivey (assist/turnover ratio of 1.25) as their back-up point guard.

The Pistons were 1-14 at home against the Western Conference last season, with that tied for the second worst home record vs. the opposite conference (minimum 11 games) for any team in NBA history. The first West team to come to Detroit this season is the Lakers on Monday, when the Pistons will be at a rest disadvantage.

The Bucks almost beat Cleveland on Saturday in what was their first clutch game of the season, but couldn’t get the stop they needed in the final seconds and are 1-5 (or worse) for the first time in 24 years.
Three takeaways

The Bucks actually got out on the break in Memphis on Thursday, scoring as many transition points (34) as they did in their previous two games combined, according to Synergy tracking. But they shot 9-for-42 (21%) from 3-point range and lost the first quarter by 16 points, trailing by as many as 31.


The Bucks have suffered big drop-offs on both ends of the floor from last season, but it’s on defense where they’ve been more consistently sub-par, allowing more than 116 points per 100 possessions in all five games of their losing streak. The defense has been a little better than average (111.7 allowed per 100) in 121 minutes with both Giannis Antetokounmpo and Brook Lopez on the floor, but has allowed more than 121 per 100 in 153 total minutes with one of the two on the floor without the other.


Overall, the Bucks have been outscored by 22.4 per 100 with Bobby Portis on the floor, with that being the third worst mark among 197 players who’ve averaged at least 20 minutes per game.

After the Bucks complete their home-and-home series with the Cavs, they’ll begin their first stretch of five games in seven days, which features tough games against the Knicks and Celtics over the weekend.

Joel Embiid and Paul George practiced on Friday, but the Sixers’ loss to the Grizzlies the following night was their fifth without the two stars.
Three takeaways

Four teams rank lower offensively overall, but the Sixers are the only team that hasn’t scored at least 110 points per 100 possessions in any game this season. They rank in the top 11 in each of the other factors on offense (free throws, turnovers and rebounds), but are 29th in effective field goal percentage, in the bottom three in both field goal percentage in the paint and effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint.


Tyrese Maxey ranks sixth in scoring at 29.8 points per game but needs the other stars to help him score more efficiently. His 2-point percentage (47.9%) and 3-point percentage (26.3%) are both the lowest marks of his career.


He’s also not getting consistent help from elsewhere in the rotation, with the Sixers’ other two double-digit scorers — Kelly Oubre Jr. and Caleb Martin — having a combined effective field-goal percentage of 42%. Rookie Jared McCain got more playing time last week and totaled 31 points against Detroit and Memphis.

Embiid is still out, but George is expected to debut as the Sixers begin a three-game trip in Phoenix on Monday. Embiid played in only three of their 15 games in Western Conference arenas last season.

The Blazers just might be more competitive this season. They got a clutch win over the Clippers on Wednesday, and then had second-half leads against the Thunder and Suns over the weekend.
Three takeaways

Those second-half leads disappeared pretty quickly, with the Blazers getting outscored by 47 points (82-35) over the two third quarters against Oklahoma City and Phoenix. Having been outscored by double-digits in two third quarters before that, they’re an amazing minus-42.2 per 100 possessions in the third period for the season. (They’d still be just 3-4 if you erased all their third quarters.)


If they are more competitive this year, it’s because of improved defense. Blazers’ opponents have taken just 42% of their shots in the paint, with that being the league’s lowest rate and down from 50% (seventh highest) last season. They’ve done that while also being one of only nine teams with a lower opponent free throw rate than they had last season.


The offense has been a struggle. The Blazers are the only team with four players — Deni Avdija, Jerami Grant, Scoot Henderson and Anfernee Simons — with an effective field goal percentage below 47% on at least 50 shots.

The Wizards weren’t competitive in their first two games, but they swept a home-and-home with the Hawks thanks, in large part, to the two-way play of Bilal Coulibaly.
Three takeaways

In the first win over the Hawks, Coulibaly scored 11 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter (even scoring as a roll man), while also doing some good work in defending Trae Young. Two nights later, he scored a career-high 27 on 11-for-14 shooting, and he followed that up with an efficient 22 in the Wizards’ loss to the Heat in Mexico City. For the season, the second-year wing has a true shooting percentage of 72.9%, second among 139 players with at least 50 field goal attempts.


With Kyle Kuzma missing the last two games with a groin strain, the Wizards have started Jordan Poole, Coulibaly (who’s 20 years old) and three rookies. They’ve gotten 33% of their minutes from rookies, the league’s highest rate by a huge margin, but still a little lower than the 35% that last season’s Blazers got from first-year guys. The Wizards have only been outscored by six points in the three rookies’ 44 total minutes on the floor together.


One of the three rookies is Alex Sarr, who continues to start at the five, with Jonas Valančiūnas coming off the bench. Only 26 (21%) of Sarr’s minutes have come alongside Valančiūnas or Marvin Bagley III, and the Wizards haven’t been so bad (minus-5.4 per 100 possessions) in the 98 minutes when the rookie has been the lone big.

The Jazz’s season was already off to a bad start, and then they’ve been without Lauri Markkanen (the only guy who can keep them somewhat afloat) for the last 2 1/2 games.
Three takeaways

The Jazz are just the fifth team in NBA history (the first in the last 16 years) to start the season 0-6 while getting outscored by at least 18 points per game. Among the previous four, the best final record belonged to the 1998-89 Kings, who finished 27-55 and in 10th place in a 13-team Western Conference.


The good news is that the Jazz ranked 22nd defensively after ranking 30th (that’s last) last season. They’d rank much higher if they could rebound. Even though they still struggle in transition, they’re eighth in initial defense (subtracting second-chance points).


On offense, the Jazz’s effective field goal percentage of 45.2% would be the lowest mark for any team in the last 13 seasons. They’ve shot no better than 31% from 3-point range in each of their last five games.

The Jazz have some winnable games on the rest of their four-game trip, especially with the way the Bucks have started the season. Seven Jazz players averaged double-figures as Utah won both games against Milwaukee last season.

The Celtics picked up right where they left off, celebrating banner No. 18 by destroying the Knicks on opening night.
Three takeaways

They were ridiculously hot as they tied the NBA record for 3-pointers on Tuesday, but the Celtics were mostly taking good shots that were the results of attacking weaker defenders and making the right reads. This is what they do.


Last season, the Celtics led 18 games by at least 30 points, with that tying the 2016-17 Warriors for the most games led by 30-plus in the 28 seasons for which we have play-by-play data. And they began this season by leading both of their first two games by at least 30 points, also building a 23-point lead in Detroit on Saturday. They’ve scored a ridiculous 118 points on 76 possessions (155.3 per 100) in the first quarter.


They blew that 23-point lead in Detroit, but have now (and going back to the end of last regular season) won their last eight games that were within five points in the last five minutes, having allowed just 51 points on 63 clutch defensive possessions (81 per 100) over that stretch. The highlight on Saturday was Derrick White helping off the corner and blocking Cade Cunningham’s dunk attempt for the tie with 51 seconds left.

A year ago, the Celtics’ first November game was a 51-point win over the Pacers, who they’d eventually meet in the (more competitive) conference finals. Their first November game this year is in Indiana, where they lost twice last season.

The Thunder have kept pace with the champs, becoming just the 11th team in NBA history to win each of its first three games by at least 15 points.
Three takeaways

The Thunder won their first two games by a total of 34 points despite shooting just 16-for-76 (21%) from 3-point range. They made as many 3-pointers against the Hawks on Sunday (16-for-40) as they made in the first two games combined.


The 3-point shooting didn’t matter because the Thunder were so dominant defensively. Their wins in Denver and Utah were two of the three times in Week 1 where a team held its opponent below 90 points per 100 possessions. Chet Holmgren’s rim protection has been rather ridiculous. He’s blocked 12 shots in the three games and opponents have shot just 15-for-34 (44.1%) at the rim when he’s been there.


On the other side of the floor, Holmgren is just 3-for-15 from 3-point range. But he’s driving more and making more plays off the dribble and on the move. He’s got seven turnovers with his nine assists, but the added aggressiveness should benefit the Thunder down the line.

Only one team in NBA history — the 1971-72, 69-13 Lakers — has won its first four games by at least 15 points. The Thunder can be the second on Wednesday when we get our first Holmgren-Wembanyama matchup of the season. The two young bigs combined to shoot just 7-for-25 (28%) in their first meeting last November, but were then a combined 33-for-60 (55%) over the next two games, with Victor Wembanyama missing the final meeting of the season.

Three takeaways

Their total margin of victory was just 18 points, but only one of the three wins (vs. Sacramento) was within five points in the last five minutes. And the Lakers already have as many wins in games they trailed by 20 points (1-0 after coming back from 22 down against the Suns) as they did last season (1-17).


Last season, the Lakers averaged 3.5 fewer shooting opportunities than their opponents, the league’s worst discrepancy. In Week 1, they totaled 15 more shooting opportunities than their opponents, with a big jump in offensive rebounding percentage being a key factor.


Anthony Davis has been huge, averaging 34 points, 11 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 2.3 blocks over the three games, with 48 of his 56 shots having come in the paint. But the Lakers have also outscored their opponents by 35 points in his 31 minutes on the bench.

The Cavs had a soft schedule in Week 1, but they took care of business and became the first team since the 2017-18 Clippers with three double-digit wins in its first three games of the season. (The Thunder joined them one night later.)
Three takeaways

The 125.5 points per 100 possessions that the Cavs’ offense has scored is better than any three-game stretch that they had after the All-Star break last season. Their effective field goal percentage of 63.2% is best in the league by a wide margin. Caris LeVert (87.5%) and Jarrett Allen (83.3%) rank first and second among 160 players with at least 20 field goal attempts.


They continue to heavily stagger the minutes of their four best players, with the four having played just 38 total minutes together over the three games. Darius Garland and Allen have played 33 minutes together without Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley, while Mitchell and Mobley have played 43 minutes without Garland and Allen. In those 76 total minutes with just one starting guard and one starting big on the floor, the Cavs are a plus-52, having scored 132.3 points per 100 possessions. (LeVert’s ridiculous shooting has obviously been a factor in those numbers.)


Their opponents have shot just 56-for-120 (46.7%) in the paint, and in their first two games, the Cavs outscored the Raptors and Pistons by a total of 40 points (86-46) in the restricted area.

The competition gets tougher this week, and no team held the Cavs to fewer points per 100 possessions last season than the Knicks, who won two of the three meetings.

The Knicks’ mixed results in Week 1 were probably more about the opponents — the difference between the Celtics and everybody else — than the Knicks themselves.
Three takeaways

The Celtics were on fire as they tied the NBA record for made 3-pointers on Tuesday, but they were getting good looks from beyond the arc, often by putting Karl-Anthony Towns in pick-and-roll. Things were bad once Towns ventured out of the paint in blitz or at-the-level coverage, but he mostly stayed in drop coverage against the Pacers on Friday (when one blitz led to a layup).


Mikal Bridges had a rough start, shooting 0-for-5 (including 0-for-4 from 3-point range) in the first half in Boston on Tuesday. Since then, he’s 15-for-20 (4-for-6 from 3). He was creating his own buckets and went 7-for-10 on pull-up 2-pointers.


Though the different results were almost entirely about the defensive end of the floor, the Knicks did retain almost 30% of available offensive rebounds on Friday. Three nights earlier, they retained just 18.4%, what would have been their second-lowest rate last season (95 total games, including playoffs). Towns improves their initial offense, but it will be interesting to track how much of their rebounding advantage they’ve lost.

The Knicks’ early-season tests continue with a visit from the Cavs on Monday. They’ve won nine of their last 11 games against Cleveland, including a 4-1, first-round series in 2023 in which they dominated the glass.

The Wolves had a disappointing start to the season, losing in L.A. on Tuesday. But they only have to look back a year, when they lost the opener in Toronto, to know that the first game doesn’t mean much. They followed up the defeat with wins over Sacramento and the Raptors.
Three takeaways

The opener was, essentially, lost with a 27-6 Lakers’ run in the second quarter in which the Wolves’ defense — in zone, in man-to-man and especially in transition — was not good. A year ago, they held their opponent under a point per possession in six of their first seven games.


The Wolves have had two of their three frontline players — Julius Randle, Rudy Gobert and Naz Reid — on the floor for all 144 minutes. As expected the defense has been at its best when Gobert has been one of the two, though the offense has been potent — 90 points on 73 possessions (123.3 per 100) — in 35 minutes with Randle and Reid together.


The Anthony Edwards-Randle pick-and-roll should be a pretty popular action down the stretch of close games, with one option out of it being Randle isolating against guards (Nowitzki-style) from the nail or elbow after a switch.

The first Western Conference finals rematch is a rest-advantage game for the Wolves on Tuesday. They were 12-3 (7-1 at home) in rest-advantage games last season.

A 2-1 start isn’t bad considering the strength of the Suns’ schedule, and they were at a rest disadvantage when they beat the Mavs on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Last season, the Suns were the league’s worst fourth-quarter team by a huge margin and 1-22 in games they trailed by double-digits in the fourth. On opening night against the Clippers, they were down 10 with less than six minutes left. But they came back and won in overtime, scoring 22 points on their final 13 possessions of regulation and holding the Clips to just 10 on 11 in the extra period.


They mostly played small down the stretch, with a center (Jusuf Nurkić) on the floor for just 3.7 of the 8.3 clutch minutes. Minutes with Kevin Durant at the five were pretty bad defensively last season.


The Suns got two games with their star trio together before Bradley Beal missed the win over Dallas with elbow soreness. Beal had shot 7-for-12 from 3-point range over the first two games, but the Suns allowed 122 points per 100 possessions in 38 total minutes with all three stars on the floor.

Beal is listed as questionable for the Suns’ game against the Lakers on Monday. The Suns will have rest advantages against the Clippers on Thursday (their second Intuit Dome game in the first nine days of the season) and against the Blazers two nights later.

The Mavs were 11-2 last season when Luka Dončić scored at least 40 points. This season, they’re 0-1, because he didn’t get enough help in Phoenix on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Dončić had just 12 assists over the Mavs’ first two games, with seven of them going to Klay Thompson, who, after a rough preseason, shot 11-for-22 from 3-point range. But the Mavs scored just 98 points on 91 possessions (107.7 per 100 – worse than the league average) in 41 total minutes with Dončić, Thompson and Kyrie Irving on the floor together.


Daniel Gafford continues to start at center, but Dereck Lively II has been playing more minutes, and the 20-year old tied a career high with six assists in the Mavs’ win over the Spurs on Thursday. Most of them were simple pass-backs to Dončić, but he also had a nice high-post feed to a cutting Naji Marshall. The Mavs have also used Maxi Kleber and P.J. Washington at the five.


The Mavs don’t move the ball much, which has the benefit of fewer opportunities to commit turnovers. And their 9.4 turnovers per 100 possessions is the league’s lowest rate.

The Mavs’ longest homestand of the season (five games over nine days) begins Thursday with a visit from the Rockets and includes three games against the Eastern Conference. They were just 8-7 at home vs. the East last season.

The Clippers are not waiting on Kawhi Leonard. They picked up two quality wins in Week 1, beating the Nuggets and Warriors (with a rest disadvantage) on the road. Their lone loss (vs. Phoenix on Wednesday) came in overtime.
Three takeaways

As noted in this space last week, the Clippers have some dudes that will get after it defensively. It’s on that end where they’ve had success, holding each of their three opponents (who all ranked in the top 10 offensively last season) under 110 points per 100 possessions. Only 42% of their opponents’ shots (the league’s second-lowest opponent rate) have come in the paint, and only 18% of their opponents’ 3-point attempts (third-lowest rate) have come from the corners.


Kris Dunn is one of those dudes, and he ranks fourth in both steals (3.2) and deflections (6.4) per 36 minutes. He picked Kevin Durant’s pocket in the opener and was all in the Warriors’ passing lanes on Sunday.


Ivica Zubac ranks fourth in defensive rebounding percentage (30.7%) and the Clippers rank fourth as a team (75%), having ranked 24th (70.5%) last season.

The Clippers’ longest homestands are two five-game stands, one early in the season and the other late. The first begins with a visit from the Blazers on Wednesday and continues with their second home game against the Suns in nine days.

The Nuggets are off to a rough start and (surprise!) bench minutes have been a problem.
Three takeaways

The Nuggets’ starting lineup outscored the Thunder and Clippers by 18 points (scoring 117 points on 99 offensive possessions) in its 48 total minutes together. All other Denver lineups have been outscored by 36 points (scoring 74 points on 97 offensive possessions) in 48 minutes. They’ve scored an incredibly anemic 28 points on 51 possessions in Nikola Jokić’s 24 minutes on the bench.


The four reserves who’ve played more than the 1:38 of garbage time against Oklahoma City have shot a combined 10-for-43 (23%) from the field, with Russell Westbrook 2-for-18 and Peyton Watson 1-for-10. Westbrook is 1-for-8 in the paint.


The good news from their loss to the Clippers on Saturday afternoon was that Jamal Murray shot 5-for-10 from outside the paint and Jokić was willing to let it fly from deep, attempting a career-high 12 3-pointers. He connected on seven of them, though he missed a shot for the tie with five seconds left, because he was trying to draw a foul.

The Nuggets now head out on a three-game trip that concludes with a big game in Minnesota on Friday. They won three of their five games at the Target Center last season, though the last one was a 45-point loss in Game 6 of the conference semis.

The Grizzlies lost their most important game of Week 1 (Friday in Houston), but won their other two and, more importantly, Jaren Jackson Jr. is back.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies have played three games, but don’t have a lineup that’s played more than 12 minutes together, and Desmond Bane leads the team at just 28.1 minutes per game. Jackson missed the first two games, the expected starters played less than seven minutes together as they clobbered the Magic on Saturday, and they’re playing an 11-man rotation.


The Grizzlies got killed on the glass in Houston, allowing 23 offensive rebounds and 27 second-chance points. After allowing another 21 second-chance points to Orlando on Saturday, they rank 29th in defensive rebounding percentage (60.7%). That number has been lower (57.7%) with starting center Zach Edey on the floor.


Ja Morant has averaged just 25.5 minutes, so his per-game numbers are a little down. Even though the Grizzlies are playing at a fast pace, his drives per 36 minutes (20.8) are a little down from his first five seasons (22.2). He’s just 2-for-12 from 3-point range, but he (10) and Scotty Pippen Jr. (11) are two of the nine players with at least 10 assists on 3-pointers through Week 1.

The Grizzlies are one game into a stretch of six straight against the Eastern Conference and two games into their first stretch of five games in seven days. They’ll have a rest advantage against Brooklyn on Wednesday but will be at a disadvantage the following night against the Bucks.

The Magic’s first week might be a good illustration of the East-West discrepancy this season. After comfortable wins over the Heat and Nets, they got clobbered by the Grizzlies on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The first two opponents shot just 37-80 (46.3%) in the paint, but the Grizzlies shot 31-for-44 (70.5%) as they outscored the Magic by 28 points (62-34) in the paint. That would have been tied for Orlando’s second-worst paint differential last season.


Paint differential might matter less this season, because Magic have taken 49.2% of their shots (third highest rate) from 3-point range, up from 36.9% (25th) last season. Franz Wagner is 10-for-22 (45%) from deep after shooting 21% after the All-Star break (including playoffs) last season and 0-for-7 in the preseason.


The Magic have outscored their opponents by 42 points (an amazing 55.6 per 100 possessions) in the third quarter, but their 21-0, third-quarter run on Sunday only cut a 29-point deficit down to eight. And once the run was over, they never got that close again.

Orlando will play two big games within the Eastern Conference this week, hosting the Pacers on Monday and visiting the Cavs four nights later. As they lost their first-round series to Cleveland in seven games, the two teams combined to score just 102.5 points per 100 possessions.

The Warriors have the two biggest wins for any team this season, beating the Blazers and Jazz by 36 and 41 points, respectively. But they lost their home opener on Sunday and lost Stephen Curry to an ankle injury along the way.
Three takeaways

When you win two games by a total of 77 points, the overall numbers are probably going to be great. On defense, the Warriors held Portland and Utah to just 41-for-91 (45.1%) in the paint, and both teams were even less effective from beyond the arc.


On offense, Buddy Hield was an amazing 12-for-16 (75%) from 3-point range through those first two games, helping the Warriors build big leads when they went to their bench. But it was the offense that really fell off on Sunday when Hield was 1-for-9 from deep, the Warriors committed 21 turnovers and they scored just 37 points on 45 possessions with Curry off the floor.


With Curry in the locker room, the Warriors closed the loss to the Clippers with a backcourt of Hield and Brandon Podziemski. Steve Kerr said that his star’s injury was “mild or moderate,” but if Curry is out this week, Podziemski’s juice off the dribble could be critical to the offense.

The road team won all three games between Golden State and New Orleans last season, with the Pelicans’ 141 points on 99 possessions in January being the most efficient performance the Warriors (who were without Draymond Green) allowed all year. They’ll play a back-to-back at Chase Center on Tuesday and Wednesday.

No Joel Embiid. No Paul George. But the Sixers got off the schneid with an overtime win in Indiana on Sunday … despite some efforts in self-sabotage.
Three takeaways

Tyrese Maxey is trying to do this thing by himself. He’s averaged 31.3 points after scoring 45 (most for any player in Week 1) on Sunday but hasn’t done it very efficiently. His true shooting percentage of 47.2% ranks last among the 44 players who’ve averaged at least 20 points per game, and he’s been assisted on just 20% of his field goals, down from 43% last season.


The Sixers’ offense has been much better with Andre Drummond on the bench, but he’s been critical on the other end of the floor. Philly has grabbed just 56.6% of available defensive rebounds with Drummond on the bench, and he came up with two huge steals late in the fourth quarter on Sunday.


This is the eighth season since the Sixers became a playoff team. Over that stretch (and including playoffs), they’re 304-158 (.658) with Embiid and now 79-85 (.482) without him.

The Pacers’ high-powered offense has yet to get in gear, and the defense has only been good enough to get a six-point win over the Pistons.
Three takeaways

Tyrese Haliburton shot a brutal 1-for-16 from 3-point range over the first two games. He was 4-for-9 against Philadelphia on Sunday (draining a double-clutch 3 to send the game to overtime), but he has just 11 total assists in 98 minutes and the Pacers have scored less than a point per possession with him on the floor.


Turnovers have also been an issue. The Pacers rank 21st in turnover rate (16.6 per 100 possessions) after ranking sixth (12.6 per 100) last season. They committed two straight in the final minute of regulation on Sunday, part of an 8-0 Sixers run that turned a five-point lead into that three-point deficit before Haliburton’s 3 for the tie.


Haliburton isn’t the only one who’s struggled from the perimeter. The Pacers lead the league in field goal percentage in the paint (70%), but rank 28th in effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint (39.5%).

The Pacers were 1-2 against the Magic last season, with the road team winning all three games. The two teams — one a top-three offense and the other a top-three defense last season — will meet twice in the next 10 days.

If you thought the Heat were looking like the No. 8 seed for a third straight season, their Week 1 results — a loss to the Magic and a win in Charlotte — probably didn’t change your mind.
Three takeaways

Perimeter shooting remains an issue. The Heat are 13-for-25 (52%) on corner 3-pointers, but just 4-for-14 (29%) from mid-range and 12-for-43 (28%) on above-the-break 3-pointers. Bam Adebayo is 0-for-8 from outside the paint and the Heat have scored less than a point per possession in his 58 minutes.


They did shoot 3-for-4 on clutch 3-pointers to get the win in Charlotte on Saturday, with Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro each draining above-the-break looks late in the shot clock and the Heat up three. Butler also had almost as many free throw attempts (17) as the Hornets (21) and has the third-highest free throw rate (83 attempts per 100 shots from the field) among 160 players with at least 20 field goal attempts.


The Heat rank last in rebounding percentage (43.7%) by a healthy margin. They were outscored by 28 (45-17) on second-chance points over the two games.

Dejounte Murray had a solid debut with the Pelicans, but fractured his left hand in the process and is out until late November (at the earliest). That simplifies things offensively, but (with Trey Murphy III also out) leaves them a little thin on the bench.
Three takeaways

After coming back from 16 points down to edge the Blazers in Portland on Friday, the Pelicans lost by 22 two nights later in the same building. The difference was defense, and it was more about free throws and rebounds than the Blazers’ shooting. Portland retained 50% of available offensive rebounds on Sunday, with that being the second-highest rate for any team in Week 1 and higher than any rate that the Pelicans allowed all of last season.


After missing the Pelicans’ opening-night win over Chicago, Zion Williamson shot just 7-for-27 (7-for-25 in the paint) in their two games in Portland. Eight (30%) of those 27 shots were blocked, with that being almost triple his rate over his first four seasons (11%). Williamson does have 24 free throw attempts to go with those 27 shots from the field, with that being the second-highest free throw rate among 160 players with at least 20 field goal attempts.


Last season, the Pelicans were 11 points per 100 possessions better in the first halves of games (plus-10.0, second best) than they were in second halves (minus-1.0, 19th), with that being the league’s biggest half-to-half differential by a healthy margin. In Week 1, they were 23.7 points per 100 possessions better after halftime.

The Kings led the Wolves by six with less than nine minutes left and were up seven on the Lakers at the start of the fourth quarter. But they allowed Minnesota to go on a 14-2 run and L.A. to run off 21 straight points. Teams were 37-7 when leading by more than five points in the fourth quarter in Week 1, with the Kings (0-2) and Pistons (0-2) accounting for four of the seven losses.


The Kings’ starting lineup and their (closing) lineup with Malik Monk in place of Kevin Huerter have outscored their opponents by 26 points (26 per 100 possessions) in 45 total minutes, allowing exactly a point per possession. All other lineups have been outscored by 32 points (29.6 per 100 possessions) in 51 minutes, allowing 137 per 100.

Yikes! After beating the shorthanded Sixers on Wednesday, the Bucks lost to Chicago (at home) and Brooklyn by double-digits. Their schedule gets much tougher this week.
Three takeaways

The Bucks were outscored by 42 points (111-69) from 3-point range over the two losses. The Bulls’ 21 3s on Friday were two more than they made in any game last season and just two fewer than the Bucks totaled over the two losses. Damian Lillard was 6-for-12 from beyond the arc in the opener, but just 4-for-19 over the weekend.


The Bucks have protected the paint better, seeing significant drops from last season in both opponent field goal percentage in the paint and the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come in the paint.


But, as was the case last season, they just don’t force turnovers. They ranked last in opponent turnover rate (11.9 per 100 possessions) last season and they’ve seen a significant drop through their first three games (10.4 per 100). That inhibits their ability to run, which is problematic when considering that they have the league’s best transition player.

The Hawks have had double-digit leads in all three games, in part because they’ve allowed just 63 points on 78 possessions (80.8 per 100) in the first quarter. They’ve allowed 129.7 per 100 after the first quarter.


It was thought that fouls would be down again this season, but the league has averaged 30 free-throw attempts per 100 shots from the field, up from 24.4 per 100 last season (22.5 per 100 after the All-Star break). The Hawks have seen the biggest jump, from 25.1 per 100 (12th) last season to an amazing 44.8 per 100 (first) this season. And three of their four guys with double-digit attempts — Trae Young, De’Andre Hunter and Onyeka Okongwu — have combined to shoot 58-for-65 (89%) from the stripe.


Okongwu scored a career-high 28 points on 11-for-12 shooting (also blocking three shots) in the win over the Nets on Wednesday. He’s played 15 more minutes than Clint Capela (who averaged more minutes last season) and Okongwu was on the floor instead of Capela down the stretch of the Hawks’ two close games, with Brooklyn and Charlotte combining to score just seven points on 10 clutch possessions.

The Hawks had a rest advantage when they lost in Oklahoma City on Sunday. They’ll be at a disadvantage Monday night against the Wizards, having gone 3-8 (3-4 at home) in rest-disadvantage games last season, with one of those three home losses having come (by 28 points) against Washington.

The Spurs split games against the Mavs and Rockets, giving them as many wins against the other Texas teams as they had all of last season (1-7).
Three takeaways

Only 14 (40%) of Victor Wembanyama’s 35 shots have come in the paint, though he’s 13-for-14 at the line, with that free-throw rate (40 attempts per 100 shots from the field) up from 31 per 100 last season. The Spurs have still outscored both of their opponents in the paint and at the free-throw line.


Over their two games, the Spurs have had 25 fewer shooting opportunities than their opponents, with the average (-12.5 per game) being the worst discrepancy in the league by a wide margin. They’ve committed 15 more turnovers than their opponents, with three of their starters — Wembanyama, Julian Champagnie and Jeremy Sochan — having registered almost twice as many turnovers (19) as assists (10).


The Spurs have been outscored by 26 points (22 per 100 possessions) in Chris Paul’s 55 minutes, though the 39-year-old has registered 11.1 assists per 36 minutes, what would be the second-highest rate of his 20-year career.

The Spurs will host the Rockets again on Monday, then travel to Oklahoma City, where they lost two games by a total of 74 points last season.

The Rockets got a good (and comfortable) win over the Grizzlies on Friday, but that was sandwiched by losses to the Hornets (in which they led by 18 points) and Spurs.
Three takeaways

A big difference between the win and the two losses was rebounding, with the Rockets grabbing 57.5% of available rebounds against Memphis, but just 46.5% over the two defeats. With a big turnover differential (15 fewer than their opponents over the three games), they’ve averaged a league-best 11.1 more shooting opportunities than their opponents.


Though Alperen Sengün wasn’t on the floor down the stretch on Saturday, the Rockets’ starting lineup has played 55 total minutes, the most in the league. It has outscored opponents by 12.9 points per 100 possessions, but bench minutes haven’t been great. Houston was outscored by 17 points in less than 26 minutes with at least one reserve on the floor in the five-point loss to Charlotte.


Amen Thompson might be one of those wings who plays like a center on offense. Early in the Charlotte game, he was completely ignored at the 3-point line. Later, he was the guy setting screens and rolling to the rim, even with Jabari Smith Jr. and Sengün on the floor.

The Rockets will play in San Antonio again on Monday before finishing their three-game trip in Dallas. The Mavs were responsible for three of the 17 times the Rockets allowed more than 125 points per 100 possessions last season.

With 22 of their first 25 games against teams that had winning records last season, the Raptors probably weren’t complaining when the Sixers were without Joel Embiid and Paul George on Friday. They took care of business against their shorthanded opponent to get their only win of Week 1.
Three takeaways

The Raptors began the season without RJ Barrett, Bruce Brown and Kelly Olynyk. Then they lost Immanuel Quickley to a hard fall in the first half of Game 1, and the attrition had somebody named Jamison Battle in the rotation. The undrafted rookie fouled out in less than 15 minutes against Philly, but he has an effective field-goal percentage of 68% on 17 shots over the three games and (even when you discount their blowout loss to the Cavs) the Raptors have been at their best with reserves on the floor.


Battle was one of three Raptors who have averaged more than 10 rebounds per 36 minutes. Toronto leads the league in total rebounding percentage (56.9%), having ranked 27th (48.4%) last season.


If you can get back in transition and keep the Raptors off the glass, you’re in good shape defensively. Through three games, 35% of their points have been fast break points or second-chance points, with that rate up from a league-high 29% last season.

The Raptors’ first game against a team that had a losing record last season is Wednesday in Charlotte, with the Hornets being one of two teams that the Raptors beat three times in ’23-24. Barrett is listed as questionable for their game against the Nuggets on Monday.

The Bulls are 1-2, but the one win was in Milwaukee, with the Bulls having lost 25 of their previous 30 games against the Bucks.
Three takeaways

As was the case in the preseason, the Bulls have seen the league’s biggest jump in 3-point rate, taking 48.9% of their shots from beyond the arc (fifth highest), up from 35.8% (29th) last season. They outscored the Bucks by 24 points (63-39) from 3-point range in their win on Friday.


The flip side of the increase in 3-pointers is that only Boston (36%) has taken a lower percentage of their shots in the paint than Chicago (40%). The Bulls have been outscored by 16 points per game (the league’s worst discrepancy) in the restricted area.


The Bulls won the turnover battle (10-15) in Milwaukee, but their turnover differential against the Thunder (26-10) was the worst of the season so far, while their differential in New Orleans (21-12) is tied for the fourth worst. Zach LaVine has 15 turnovers and just seven assists. (Chicago ranked third in turnover differential last season.)

The Bulls will continue to alternate home and road games for the next 17 days. With the Milwaukee win, they’re 1-0 against 2024 East playoff teams, having gone 10-20 against them last season. They’re set to host the Magic (who’ve seen the second-biggest jump in 3-point rate) on Wednesday.

The Hornets have trailed all three of their games by at least 14 points. They got a nice comeback win in Houston on Wednesday, but the comebacks fell short against the Hawks and Heat.
Three takeaways

Those deficits have come via some ugly offensive starts, with the Hornets scoring just 60 points on 76 first-quarter possessions (78.9 per 100). Tre Mann has come off the bench and shot 1-for-10 (0-for-5 from 3-point range) in the opening 12 minutes.


But Mann is the only guy who has been on the floor for all nine minutes of clutch time, and the Hornets had the ball in his hands on some (scripted) possessions late in the Houston win. He drained a wicked step-back 3 over Jalen Green and a tough floater on a drive against Dillon Brooks.


The Hornets are one of two teams (the Clippers are the other) that have played three games that were within five points in the last five minutes. Against Miami and Atlanta, they didn’t get enough stops down the stretch. Overall, the Hornets have allowed 33 points on 23 clutch defensive possessions.

Their rest-disadvantage loss to the Heat on Saturday was the start of a four-game homestand that concludes with a weekend back-to-back against the Celtics. First, they’ll host the Raptors, with all four Charlotte-Toronto meetings last season having been within five points in the last five minutes.

The Blazers lost Game 1 by 36 points, lost Game 2 by two, and won Game 3 by 22. So at that rate of progression, they’ll win the final game of the season by 2,313 points.
Three takeaways

After allowing 119 points on just 84 possessions (142 per 100) over the final 36 minutes of their opening-night loss to the Warriors, the Blazers allowed just 104.5 per 100 in their two games against the Pelicans. The Warriors (unsurprisingly) shot better from 3-point range, but the bigger difference was in the paint, where Golden State shot 72% and New Orleans shot just 46% (with Zion Williamson just 7-for-25).


Over the two games, the Blazers outscored the Pelicans by 26 points (88-62) in the restricted area. Portland ranked 29th in restricted-area differential (-5.3 points per game) last season.


The offense broke out on Sunday when Jerami Grant and Anfernee Simons combined to score 55 points (Deandre Ayton added 17 on 7-for-9 shooting). The Blazers’ three highest-paid players played just 19 games together last season.

Having played their first three games at home, the Blazers will now play six of their next seven on the road, and they’ll be at a rest disadvantage in Sacramento on Monday. They were 5-4 (3-1 on the road) in rest-disadvantage games last season.

The Nets were somewhat competitive in road losses to the Hawks and Magic, and new coach Jordi Fernandez got his first win against the Bucks on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Cam Thomas’ low usage rate in the preseason was a ruse and he leads the Nets in regular-season usage rate by a healthy margin. But he’s also taken more efficient shots as he’s averaged 30.7 points in 34.6 minutes per game. He’s taken 66% of his shots from the restricted area or 3-point range, up from just 49% over his first three seasons.


It’s good that Ben Simmons is healthy, but the Nets have been much better with him off the floor (plus 18.6 points per 100 possessions) than they’ve been with him on it (minus 21.2). Their lineup with Nic Claxton in Simmons’ place (with the other four starters) is a plus-17 in less than 13 minutes.


The Nets somehow have an opponent free-throw rate of 48 attempts per 100 shots from the field, which would (not surprisingly) be the highest opponent rate in (at least) the last 55 years. Simmons (7.0), Jalen Wilson (6.4) and Ziaire Williams (6.1) are three of the eight players (league-wide) who’ve played at least 50 minutes and averaged more than six fouls per 36.

The Nets have a league-high 15 rest-advantage games this season, with the first of the 15 against the Nuggets on Tuesday. But that’s also the start of their first stretch of five games in seven days, with both rest-disadvantage games in that stretch coming against the Grizzlies.

The Pistons impressively erased a 23-point deficit and almost handed Boston its first loss on Saturday, but they’re 0-3 for the seventh time in the last 15 years.
Three takeaways

Two of the three losses were within five points in the last five minutes, but the Pistons just couldn’t get the buckets they needed to get a win, scoring just 11 points on 16 clutch possessions, with Cade Cunningham and Tobias Harris each shooting 0-for-4 in the clutch. Last season, the Pistons scored less than a point per clutch possession in 15 of their first 20 games that were within five points in the last five minutes.


After shooting 8-for-14 from mid-range in the preseason, Cunningham is 7-for-13 (54%) through three games. He was doing some nice work in the post (three straight scores) against the Pacers on Wednesday, and is tied for second with 12 total post-up points, according to Synergy tracking.


Going back to the start of last season, the Pistons are now 0-33 against the eight 2024 Eastern Conference playoff teams.

They’ll get three more chances to get a win against that group this week. Three of their four losses to the Heat last season were within five points in the last five minutes, and they’ll be in Miami on Monday.

For the first time in 10 years (since the 2014-15 season), the Jazz are off to an 0-2 start.
Three takeaways

Last season, Lauri Markkanen had a positive plus-minus (the Jazz outscored their opponents by 0.6 points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor) for a team that was 31-51. On Wednesday, he was a plus-16 (in almost 35 minutes) in a game the Jazz lost by two. Over their two games last week, the Jazz scored 115.2 points per 100 possessions with Markkanen on the floor and just 74.4 per 100 (58 on 78) with him off the floor.


The defensive numbers were not good whether Markkanen was on the floor or not. Bad defense for the Jazz, once again, begins with transition. They allowed the Grizzlies and Warriors to average 35.5 transition points per game, a rate that would destroy the record for most allowed in the 21 seasons of Synergy data.


Their issues with transition defense have again begun with turnovers. The Jazz have committed 18.8 per 100 possessions (second most), with their starting backcourt — Keyonte George and Collin Sexton — having as many total turnovers (14) as assists (14). George has also shot just 7-for-30, including just 3-for-16 inside the arc.

Three takeaways

It’s been a rough start defensively, with the Wizards ranking in the bottom five in both opponent 2-point percentage (57.4%, 26th) and opponent 3-point percentage (41.7%, 30th).


Rookie Alex Sarr has been starting at the five, with Jonas Valančiūnas coming off the bench, though the starting lineup has played just 19 total minutes together over the two games. It’s scored a pretty anemic 34 points on 42 possessions (81 per 100) in those 19 minutes, having shot 4-for-20 from 3-point range. Jordan Poole is actually 10-for-18 from deep, but Kyle Kuzma (0-for-9) and (reserve) rookie Kyshawn George (0-for-8) are two of the three players (Cam Whitmore is the other) with at least eight 3-point attempts and no makes.


The Wizards were also outscored by 15 points (allowing 47 on 33 possessions) in 15 minutes with Sarr and Valančiūnas on the floor together. (They were a minus-27 in 29 preseason minutes together.)

The last time the Wizards were in Atlanta was one of the three times last season that the Hawks scored less than a point per possession. The two teams play a home-and-home set before the Wizards head to Mexico City to face the Heat.

For a team that was haunted by offensive woes for much of last season, it's a mildly concerning start."

Despite losing Paul George in free agency and not getting a single minute from Kawhi Leonard, the Los Angeles Clippers have been, at the very least, frisky.
They've lost two games to the Phoenix Suns, but they had them on the ropes both times. They beat the Denver Nuggets and Golden State Warriors on the road. The only really concerning outcome was a one-point loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.
And James Harden's ""I am a system"" approach from his days with the Houston Rockets is a big reason why. After registering a triple-double in Thursday's loss to the Suns, he's now averaging 23.8 points, 11.6 assists and 8.0 rebounds.
His playmaking in the middle of the floor is pretty clearly driving Ivica Zubac's breakout, too. As Harden's primary pick-and-roll target, Zubac is averaging 19.2 points and 13.2 rebounds.
Still, with Harden's age, Kawhi's health and the lack of starpower throughout the rest of the roster, it's tough to buy this team as a strong playoff contender."

And while wins might be a little bittersweet for Bulls fans angling for a top pick in this summer's draft, that dream isn't out of reach either.

Coughing up a 24-point, second-half lead and letting the game get to overtime wasn't great, but closing out the defending champs in the extra period was.
And even if the Pacers are below .500, and Tyrese Haliburton is shooting just 34.6 percent from the field, there's a new reason for optimism on the roster in 2024-25.

He's yet to appear in a game this season, and the team just got fined for not being forthcoming about his status.
Sources said the NBA's investigation showed that the Sixers did not violate player participation policy with Embiid's missed games, but in fact with the public comments that did not properly reflect his health issues with his knee. https://t.co/8HrLPpCVfv
The bigger problem, of course, is that his absence, however it's explained, makes Philadelphia an underdog against just about anyone.
Two of the Sixers' losses came to the Toronto Raptors and Detroit Pistons (neither of whom made the 2024 playoffs), and Tyrese Maxey is taking on an unsustainable burden without the former MVP.

That net rating is 28th in the league right now. Only the Pelicans and Jazz are worse in that category. This week alone, they lost by double digits to the Nets and got blown out by a short-handed Memphis Grizzlies team that was missing Desmond Bane and Marcus Smart.
And when your numbers are this bad, the problems typically aren't confined to one end of the floor. Teams are scoring at will on the Bucks, who simply look old on defense.
And on the other end, Giannis Antetokounmpo is the only reliable source of offense. Damian Lillard is averaging 23.2 points, but he's shooting 41.3 percent from the field and 26.7 percent from deep.
It's fair to point out that Khris Middleton is missing, but it's also hard to imagine a 33-year-old wing coming off surgery on both ankles being an instant fix.
Last season, Milwaukee thought a midseason coaching change would provide the jolt of life it desperately needed. At this point, it's fair to say that jolt never came. And now Bucks fans have to be wondering what's next.
X is already teeming with speculation about coach Doc Rivers' future and possible Giannis trades. And if this trend doesn't change soon, something might have to happen on one of those fronts."

Kentavious Caldwell-Pope looks like an easy fit, even as he's struggling with his outside shot. Anthony Black suddenly looks like a contributor. And Wagner's threes are falling.
Most importantly, Paolo Banchero appeared to be making a genuine star turn. He had a 50-point, near-triple-double in a win over the Indiana Pacers. And for the season, he's averaging 29.0 points 8.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 2.2 threes.
Unfortunately, his last game was followed up with some terrible news for the Magic and their fans.
Devastating injury for Banchero and loss for the Magic.

The additions, Russell Westbrook and Dario Šarić, have ranged from looking out of place to being actively detrimental. Peyton Watson and Julian Strawther are flying around on defense, but their effort has yet to be harnessed for much positive impact.
At best, it's going to take a while for that second unit to find its way.
In the meantime, three-time MVP Nikola Jokić looks ready to keep this team afloat. His team's season-long plus-minus may be under water, but it's plus-15 when Jokić is on the floor.

Randle's shaky jumper and tendency to stop the ball on offense made his acquisition a bit of a head-scratcher, since his skill set doesn't seem like an easy fit alongside Ant.

In the overtime win at Toronto, Westbrook went 3-for-7 with nine points, four rebounds and three assists and had a season-high 22 points in the Nuggets' overtime win against the Nets.

They had a couple of scares last week, but the Cavs remain unbeaten and are the 12th team in NBA history to start the season with 11 straight wins.
Three takeaways

If there’s an unsustainable aspect to this start, it’s certainly the league-best 42.2% from 3-point range. The Cavs were 14-for-22 from deep as they outscored the Warriors (who entered the game with the league’s best point differential) by 41 points in the first half on Friday. They cooled off the following night against Brooklyn but made up for it in the paint, where Evan Mobley scored 18 of his 23 points.


The Cavs’ starting lineup (with Isaac Okoro as the fifth guy) was outscored by 11 points in less than 10 minutes against Brooklyn, but they’ve now outscored their opponents by 28.3 points per 100 possessions in Caris LeVert’s 210 minutes, with that being the highest on-court mark among 300 players who’ve averaged at least 10 minutes per game. They closed the Brooklyn win with LeVert and Ty Jerome (who had a huge bucket in the final minute) instead of Okoro and Jarrett Allen.


Darius Garland only had 20 points against the Nets, having dropped 39 and 27 against Milwaukee and Golden State earlier in the week. But he was efficient and now has an effective field goal percentage of 66%, up from 52.4% last season (which wasn’t far off from his marks of the previous two years).

The Cavs were a league-best 9-1 in rest-advantage games last season, but have just two rest advantages in their first 40 games of ’24-25. Both of them — Wednesday in Philadelphia and Sunday vs. the Hornets — are this week.

Stephen Curry is back, and the Warriors (though they got clobbered by the Cavs) went 2-1 in their gauntlet of games in Boston, Cleveland and Oklahoma City.
Three takeaways

The Warriors’ first five games were more about the defense allowing less than a point per possession. The last five games (a 4-1 trip) have been more about the offense scoring 119.7 per 100. Buddy Hield hasn’t cooled off much, Jonathan Kuminga has been terrific since moving to the bench, and Draymond Green is now 14-for-31 (45%) from 3-point range this season.


The Warriors continue to start Trayce Jackson-Davis at the five, but Kevon Looney has been on the floor down the stretch of all three of their close games. And the two biggest buckets in their win in Boston were Looney put-backs that gave them four-point leads in the final two minutes. Looney didn’t play in Oklahoma City on Sunday (probably because the Thunder didn’t have a center after Chet Holmgren was hurt), but he leads the league in offensive rebounding percentage by a huge margin, having grabbed 19.4% of available offensive boards while he’s been on the floor.


Last season, the Warriors were outscored by 4.5 points in transition, the league’s third-worst discrepancy, according to Synergy tracking. This season, they’re a plus-11.6 per game in transition, the league’s best differential, having seen dramatic improvement on both ends of the floor. They were a plus-16 in transition (30-14) in their six-point win in Boston.

The Warriors have just two games this week, and they’re their two NBA Cup home games. They scored just 107.5 points per 100 possessions as they lost three of their four games against the Mavs last season.

There have been many injuries around the league, but none is more devastating than the Thunder losing Chet Holmgren for at least two months with a hip fracture suffered early in their loss to Golden State on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Holmgren’s injury hurts more with Isaiah Hartenstein and Jaylin Williams also out. The Thunder started 6-foot-4 Lu Dort at the five in the second half vs. the Warriors on Sunday, and may be calling on Ousmane Dieng to play center until one of the other bigs gets back. Unsurprisingly, the loss to the Warriors was the Thunder’s worst defensive game of the season (127 points allowed on 99 possessions).


Is more Alex Caruso a solution? He was guarding Nikola Jokić for a bit on Wednesday when the Thunder picked up their first loss in what was also their first game that was within five points in the last five minutes. Caruso (though not guarding Jokic late) was Caruso on the floor down the stretch and has averaged 7.6 deflections per 36 minutes (second in the league), but he’s played just 19.5 minutes per game, with three other guards/wings continuing to take turns as the team’s fifth starter.


Jalen Williams has taken 29.6% of his shots from 3-point range, up from 24.3% last season. But there’s been a big difference between his 3s off the catch (13-for-27, 48%) and his 3s off the dribble (5-for-20, 25%).

The Thunder went 1-3 in NBA Cup play last season, and their first Cup game this year — Friday vs. Phoenix — is a matchup of two of the three 8-2 teams in the West. The final four games of their six-game homestand are all against 2024 Western Conference playoff teams.

The Celtics haven’t been particularly sharp, and they were without Jaylen Brown for four games before his return on Sunday. But a not-particularly-sharp Celtics team is still better than most teams at their best.
Three takeaways

A year ago, the Celtics won their first 20 home games. Before Wednesday, they had won their previous 16 games that Jaylen Brown had missed and their previous 27 that they led by more than five points in the fourth quarter. But they couldn’t hold onto a seven-point, fourth-quarter lead against the Warriors, allowing Golden State to score 25 points on 12 clutch possessions.


The defense was better down the stretch of their overtime win over the Nets on Friday (16 points allowed on 18 clutch possessions), though the Celtics had some issues when Al Horford was targeted in the pick-and-roll. We can expect opponents to have “attack Horford” at or near the top of their offensive game plan all season.


The Celtics somehow trailed 16-2 at the start of both of their games (vs. Brooklyn, at Milwaukee) over the weekend. But they still rank as the league’s second-best first-quarter team (plus-19.7 points per 100 possessions). Jayson Tatum has an effective field-goal percentage of 67.9% in first quarters and just 51% thereafter.

The Celtics open NBA Cup action by hosting the Hawks on Tuesday, eight days after winning in Atlanta by 30. They’ll have their first rest-disadvantage game of the season the following night in Brooklyn, having gone 9-2 (3-2 on the road) in rest-disadvantage games last season.

Kevin Durant is out with a calf strain, depriving us from watching him go to work on late-and-critical possessions in (essentially) every Suns game.
Three takeaways

Eight of the Suns’ 10 games have been within five points in the last five minutes, and Durant is 12-for-19 on clutch shots, with huge buckets coming against the Sixers and Heat last week. He’s just 2-for-7 on clutch 3s, but one of those makes was a completely unbothered pull-up over an earnest contest from Daniel Gafford as the Suns got a big win in Dallas on Friday. The Suns remain undefeated (7-0) in clutch games with Durant in uniform, but their seven-game winning streak ended Sunday when they couldn’t get late stops against the Kings, who scored 26 points on 16 clutch possessions.


With all the close wins, the Suns are tied for the West’s best record but have the conference’s 10th best point differential (+2.1 per game). Statistically, they’re a worse team than they were last season (plus-3.1 per game, plus-3.1 per 100 possessions).


The drop-off has mostly been on offense. The Suns have seen the league’s biggest drop in turnover rate (good), but also its biggest drop in offensive rebounding percentage (not good). They’ve also become even more of a jump-shooting team, taking only 40% of their shots in the paint, the league’s second-lowest rate and down from 46% last season.

The Suns’ NBA Cup opener in Utah on Tuesday is the start of a four-game trip and their first stretch of five games in seven days. Their second Cup game is their first meeting with the Thunder, who swept the three-game series last season. Devin Booker played in just one of the three games, but the Suns lost that one by 25.

The Nuggets lost Aaron Gordon for multiple weeks before they got Jamal Murray back from a three-game absence, but they’ve seemingly put their early-season worries behind them, winning five straight (and seven of their last eight) games.
Three takeaways

The bench had some good nights last week. On Monday, the Nuggets rallied from a double-digit, fourth-quarter deficit for the second time against the Raptors and got their first win in a game in which they were outscored with Nikola Jokić on the floor. (They had two such wins last season.)


On Wednesday (with Murray still out), Julian Strawther didn’t shoot well, but the lineup with him in Russell Westbrook’s place outscored Oklahoma City by 17 points in 11 minutes. Peyton Watson (starting for Gordon) got the game-sealing block as Denver handed the Thunder their first loss of the season.


But with Murray back for the last two games, bench minutes were not so good, with Denver getting outscored by 28 points in his 23 minutes on the bench. The solution may be to, somehow, keep Strawther and Westbrook separated. Denver has been outscored by 21.4 points per 100 possessions in their 147 minutes on the floor together, but it’s a plus-5.1 per 100 in 166 total minutes with one on the floor without the other.

The Nuggets have four days off before beginning a stretch where they’re playing nine of 12 on the road. It begins Friday with their NBA Cup opener in New Orleans, where they lost a Cup game last November, one of three games last season where they never held a lead.

The Wolves aren’t quite defending at the same level they did last season, but they’ve allowed less than a point per possession in three of their last four games. Unfortunately, that wasn’t good enough on Sunday.
Three takeaways

On Thursday, the Wolves had the most efficient offensive game (135 points on 98 possessions) for any team since the Celtics’ blowout of the Knicks on opening night. That included 79 points on 51 possessions (155 per 100) in the second half when they turned a five-point deficit into a 16-point win in the final nine minutes. Overall, Minnesota has seen the league’s eighth-biggest jump in points scored per 100 possessions from last season (114.6, 17th).


Twenty-four hours later, the Wolves outscored the Blazers by 48 points (66-18) from 3-point range, with that being the largest 3-point differential since that same Knicks-Celtics game on opening night. This season, the Wolves are a plus-16.8 per game from beyond the arc. That would be the fourth biggest differential in the 46 seasons of the 3-point line (though second to the Celtics this season).


Finally, on Sunday, the Wolves became the second team to lose a game (the Bulls were the first) in which it allowed less than a point per possession. After scoring more than 125 per 100 over their three-game winning streak, their offense came up empty against the Heat. They’ve seen the league’s biggest drop in free throw rate from last season and they had just 13 attempts in the one-point loss, unable to make up for a rough night from the perimeter.

The Wolves will play five of their next six games on the road, with both of their road NBA Cup games this week. The second is Friday in Sacramento, where they won by two (on Anthony Edwards’ free throws with 2.4 seconds left) in Week 1.

The Grizzlies are 0-3 against the Nets and Bulls but have won five of their last six games, despite absences from three starters.
Three takeaways

Regarding health, this season has, so far, been a continuation of last season. Desmond Bane and Marcus Smart have each missed the last six games, while Ja Morant was lost for the weekend (and beyond) with a hip injury. The Grizzlies’ most-used lineup has still played just 34 total minutes.


Fortunately, the Grizzlies have played the league’s easiest schedule regarding cumulative opponent winning percentage. Before Friday, they had been almost 23 points per 100 possessions better with Morant on the floor (plus-13.9) than they’d been with him off the floor (minus-9.0). But they got to play the Wizards and Blazers without him over the weekend, and they won the two games by 69 total points.


With Morant playing just nine games last season, Jaren Jackson Jr. saw a big jump in usage rate and a big drop in efficiency from the season prior. This season, he’s registering a career-best effective field goal percentage of 62.3%, even though he’s been assisted on just 56% of his buckets, the lowest mark in his seven seasons.

The Grizzlies’ three-game trip gets progressively tougher with each game and concludes with their NBA Cup opener at Golden State on Friday. A stretch where they’re playing seven of eight at home begins with a two-game series against the Nuggets, with the first game on Sunday.

The Kings had a hiccup against the Clippers last week, but have still won six of their last eight games, picking up a quality victory in Phoenix on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Against Toronto on Wednesday, Domantas Sabonis recorded just the second perfect triple-double (with no missed shots and no turnovers) in (at least) the last 42 years, with the previous coming from Nikola Jokić in 2018. Sabonis has seen a drop in usage rate but is still averaging a career-high 20.5 points per game because of a big jump in efficiency. His true shooting percentage of 72.3% would be the highest mark in NBA history for a player averaging at least 16 points per game.


Of course, it wouldn’t be good if Sabonis remained the Kings’ best 3-point shooter. De’Aaron Fox, Keegan Murray and Malik Monk have all shot below 30% on 3-pointers and the Kings have been outscored by 12.6 points per game from beyond the arc. Only the Blazers have a worse discrepancy.


The Kings’ loss to the Clippers on Friday counted as a clutch loss, because they got to within four with less than three minutes left, only to have Norman Powell drain a 3-pointer on the next possession to end a 7-0 run. They have a losing record (3-4) in games that have been within five in the last five, but they scored 43 points on 28 clutch possessions in their wins in Miami and Phoenix last week. Fox, Sabonis and DeMar DeRozan have combined to shoot 30-for-50 (60%) in the clutch this season.

The Kings’ overtime win in Phoenix on Sunday started their first stretch of five games in seven days, with their first rest-disadvantage games of the season coming on Monday in San Antonio and Saturday against the Jazz.

Three takeaways

The Pacers scored an anemic 83 points on 94 possessions in the loss to the Hornets but scored 127.2 per 100 over their three wins last week. Bennedict Mathurin has been starting in place of Aaron Nesmith (ankle injury) and has averaged 24 points on an effective field goal percentage of 67.6% over the four games total.


Mathurin is shooting (an unsustainable) 19-for-38 (50%) from 3-point range this season. But he’s also seen improvement inside, shooting 37-for-58 (64%) in the paint, up from 49% through his first two seasons. He has also always been able to get to the line, with his free throw rate of 54 attempts per 100 shots from the field ranking third (behind only Anthony Davis and Zion Williamson) among 99 players with at least 100 field goal attempts.


There were eight seconds of clutch time on Sunday (before a Myles Turner 3-pointer put Indiana up seven with 4:52 left), so the Pacers remain one of two teams — the Sixers are the other — without a win that wasn’t within five points in the last five minutes.

It’s been a somewhat disappointing start, but the Pacers might be finding their stride and have a good chance to reach the NBA Cup elimination rounds for the second straight year because the rest of East Group B is the Pistons, Heat, Bucks and Raptors. Their toughest game of the four could be Friday against Miami.

The Mavs went just 2-3 on their longest homestand of the season, then beginning a three-game trip with a loss in Denver.
Three takeaways

The Mavs’ two weekend losses were by a total of three points to the Suns and Nuggets, and all four losses in this 2-4 stretch have been within five points in the last five minutes, while the two wins have each been by 20-plus. That’s how Dallas is 5-5 with top-10 marks on both ends of the floor.


But defense could be a concern, with the Mavs having allowed 124.6 points per 100 possessions over their three losses last week. The three offenses – those of Indiana, Phoenix and Denver – all have the potential to rank in the top five by season’s end, but none of the three have started the year on fire.


The Mavs have been shorthanded on the frontline, with P.J. Washington and Dereck Lively II having missed the last three and four games, respectively. Maxi Kleber was available (for the first time since Week 1) on Sunday, but didn’t play, with Daniel Gafford logging a season-high 34 minutes against Nikola Jokic (who scored 37 points and grabbed eight offensive rebounds). Dallas has now registered a rebounding percentage below 50% in eight of its 10 games.

With their longest homestand of the season in the books, the Mavs’ loss in Denver on Sunday began a stretch where they’re playing 11 of 15 on the road. That stretch continues with their NBA Cup opener at Golden State, with the Mavs having lost both of their Cup road games last season.

The Rockets are staying afloat in the deep Western Conference, winning with the same defense that made them the league’s most-improved team a year ago.
Three takeaways

The Rockets ranked 10th defensively last season and have seen the league’s 10th-biggest drop in points allowed per 100 possessions. They couldn’t stop the Thunder on Friday, but otherwise allowed just 101.7 per 100 possessions as they went 3-1 last week. Houston ranks third in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (53.2%), having held the Knicks to just 19-for-50 in the paint on Monday.


The Rockets’ starters have played the fourth most minutes of any lineup in the league (150), but Amen Thompson and Tari Eason have sometimes been on the floor as seven of the Rockets’ 10 games have been within five points in the last five minutes. Thompson (who was guarding Jalen Brunson down the stretch) might have had the biggest play in their win over the Knicks when he rolled to the rim, faked a kick-out pass and put the Rockets up five with a dunk. Eason then made the biggest play on Sunday, saving a loose ball and finding Dillon Brooks under the basket with a little less than two minutes left.


The team has outscored its opponents by 12 points per 100 possessions in 171 total minutes with both Eason and Thompson on the floor together. (It was plus 20.3 in just 72 minutes last season.)

The Rockets’ win in Detroit on Sunday was the start of a stretch of six straight games against teams that rank in the bottom 12 offensively, and they return to Houston for a three-game homestand that includes two big games against the Clippers. Their visit to Chicago on Sunday is the start of their first stretch of five games in seven days.

The Lakers went 1-4 on their first road trip of the season but improved to 5-0 at home with wins over the Sixers and Raptors over the weekend.
Three takeaways

It was a pretty good week for LeBron James. After scoring a season-high 39 points in Memphis, he recorded triple-doubles in the two home wins. Within his 16 assists against Toronto on Sunday were some truly special dimes, and his assist/turnover ratio of 3.18 would be the highest of his career by a pretty wide margin.


The 39-point performance came with Anthony Davis missing a game for the first time this season, while the triple-doubles coincided with Cam Reddish replacing D’Angelo Russell in the Lakers’ starting lineup. The new lineup wasn’t bad over the weekend, but the Lakers were at their best with reserves (including Russell) on the floor.


The Lakers remain in the bottom five defensively, having allowed more than 121 points per 100 possessions over the five-game trip. But they should be able to move up (playing four straight games against bottom-10 offenses) in the next few weeks.

The Lakers begin the defense of their reigning NBA Cup title with the first of two visits to San Antonio in the next 17 days. They split a two-game series in San Antonio last season, winning the game that Davis played in and getting clobbered in the one he missed.

The Clippers might be pretty good. They’ve won four straight games, including one in which they came back from 26 points.
Three takeaways

Defense can make up for a lack of top-line talent, and while two-time Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard remains a spectator, the Clippers have a top-five defense. They have some dogs on the perimeter, but rebounding is also a big part of the defense, and the Clippers have seen the league’s biggest jump in defensive rebounding percentage. They won in Sacramento on Friday, improving to 3-0 on the road by (in part) holding the Kings to just seven second-chance points.


James Harden has shot just 15-for-48 (31%) (and has 17 turnovers) over the last three games, but Norman Powell continues to score efficiently, shooting an incredible 19-for-31 (61%) from 3-point range over the winning streak. Powell has shot better than 50% on both pull-up 2-pointers (13-for-25) and pull-up 3s (21-for-40).


The Clippers’ starting lineup was outscored by 14 points in 16 minutes against the Spurs on Monday when the league’s fifth-ranked bench fueled a comeback from 26 points down. Since the start of the 2021-22 season, the Clips have five wins in games they’ve trailed by at least 25 points, while no other team has more than two.

The Clippers are one of only two teams (the Cavs are obviously the other) without a road loss but will face a tough road test on Monday when they visit the Thunder. They’ll have a rest advantage, but also had one (at home) against OKC nine days ago, when they had their worst offensive performance (92 points on 100 possessions) of the season.

Only three Eastern Conference teams are .500 or better, and the Knicks aren’t one of them, having lost three of their last four games.
Three takeaways

That the Knicks are 4-5 with the league’s second-ranked offense tells you where their issues begin. Their starting lineup has allowed 122 points per 100 possessions, the worst mark among 10 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes. Some of that is 3-point shooting (42.2%) which should drop with time, but opponents have also shot 63% inside the arc with the starters on the floor.


The Knicks are also 4-5 with a positive point differential, having lost four of their five games that were within five points in the last five minutes. They’ve grabbed less than 30% of available rebounds with the score within five in the last five and their inability to grab a board (without fouling) hurt them down the stretch in Atlanta on Wednesday.


They didn’t have to worry about clutch time on Friday when they beat the Bucks by 22 (when Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart combined for 16 assists and zero turnovers). Brunson’s scoring efficiency is down a little from his first two seasons in New York, but his assist/turnover ratio of 3.69 is the best mark of his career by a wide margin. Hart, meanwhile, is averaging a career-high 5.1 assists per game, having dished out 28 over the last four.

The Knicks and Sixers are two of the three teams (Miami is the other) that have yet to play a back-to-back. They’ll both begin their first back-to-back of the season when they open Emirates Cup play in Philadelphia on Tuesday, also the start of the Knicks’ first stretch of five games in seven days. The last four games of that stretch are at home and against the Bulls, Nets (x 2) and Wizards.

After losing their first three games against the Western Conference, the Heat got an impressive win (without Jimmy Butler) in Minnesota on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The win came via a great inbounds play for a Nikola Jović and-one layup in what was the first game that Jović didn’t start. The Heat’s regular lineup has been outscored by 20.8 points per 100 possessions, one reason why both Haywood Highsmith and rookie Pelle Larsson had played more minutes than Jović through the Heat’s first four November games. Highsmith and Kevin Love (making his season debut) started in place of Butler (ankle) and Jović on Sunday when Jaime Jaquez Jr. also returned from a three-game absence.


When Tyler Herro hit Jović for the big bucket on Sunday, three players on the floor celebrated toward the bench (because of the play design) instead of with the guy who just scored. Ultimately, the play was just a single back-screen that should have been switched, but the initial formation clearly had the Wolves confused.


The Heat also played a lot of zone on Sunday, having also played a lot in Denver two nights earlier. Their 9.9 possessions of zone per game leads the league but is still down from 12 last season and 18.8 the season prior, according to Synergy tracking.

The second half of the Heat’s six-game trip is against the Eastern Conference, with their first two NBA Cup games in Detroit and Indiana. They beat the Pistons in Week 2 despite the starting lineup getting outscored by nine points in its 11 minutes.

After losing their first four games without Paolo Banchero (the last four games of an 0-5 trip), the Magic have won two straight, handling their business against the Pelicans and Wizards.
Three takeaways

Games 3 and 4 of the Magic’s 0-5 trip — losses in Dallas and Oklahoma City — were two of the five worst offensive games for any team this season. They made 17 3-pointers on Sunday, but have still shot just 26.3% from beyond the arc over these six games without Banchero. Orlando’s bigs — Jonathan Isaac, Mo Wagner, Goga Bitadze and Wendell Carter Jr. — shot a combined 5-for-35 on 3-pointers.


Carter has also missed five of the last six games, but the absence of the starting frontline hasn’t hurt the Magic inside, as they’ve outscored their last four opponents by 102 points (25.5 per game) in the restricted area. Franz Wagner was one of six players with at least 20 restricted-area buckets last week, with the other five all being full or part-time centers.


The Magic are 4-0 at home and 1-6 on the road, having been 26.5 points per 100 possessions better at the Kia Center (plus-19.3) than they’ve been elsewhere (minus-7.2). That’s the league’s biggest home-road differential by a wide margin.

The rest of the Magic’s five-game homestand includes their two NBA Cup home games, and all three games are against teams currently in the bottom half of the league defensively. Both of their games with the Pacers have been within five points in the last five minutes.

The Nets remain competitive, holding fourth-quarter leads in Boston and Cleveland over the weekend before coming up short down the stretch both nights.
Three takeaways

After coming off the bench in his first six games, Nic Claxton has started the last three, and the Nets’ lineup with him at the five has outscored opponents by 13.2 points per 100 possessions, the third best mark among the 19 lineups that have played at least 75 total minutes. It has the best defensive mark (104.6 allowed per 100) in that group, having held two of the league’s top three offenses to just 92 points on 90 possessions (102 per 100) over the weekend.


Of course, the Celtics and Cavs are also terrific defensively, and when those games got tight, the Nets scored just 23 points on 27 clutch possessions, shooting 8-for-26 from the field. Their defensive numbers haven’t been much better in the clutch and four of their six losses have been by five points or fewer, with three of those at the hands of the Nuggets, Celtics and Cavs.


Cam Thomas ranks sixth in usage rate and leads the Nets at 25.2 points per game, but Dennis Schröder might be more important to the offense. He ranks second (behind only Trae Young) in time of possession and has an effective field goal percentage of 60.2% on pull-up jumpers, the fifth best mark among 34 players with at least 50 pull-up attempts. The Nets have been outscored by 41 points (23.5 per 100 possessions) in Thomas’ 97 minutes on the floor without Schröder.

The Nets get a little schedule reprieve with their visit to New Orleans on Monday, but then play their next three games against Boston and New York. They’ve lost five straight to the Celtics and are 0-6 against the Knicks (having won the previous nine meetings) since trading Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.

The Bulls got Zach LaVine back from a three-game absence and put an end to a four-game losing streak on Saturday, coming back from 18 points down (familiar territory) to win in Atlanta.
Three takeaways

The Bulls have been outscored by 22 points per 100 possessions (the league’s second-worst mark) in the first quarter and have trailed in nine of their 10 games by at least 15 points. Chicago, Denver and Phoenix (three each) account for nine of the league’s 17 wins when trailing by at least 15.


The Bulls won the first quarter for the first time on Thursday and led the Wolves by five early in the fourth, but somehow lost by 16. Overall, the Wolves’ 135 points on 98 possessions (the slowest-paced game the Bulls have played) was the most efficient offensive game for any team since the Celtics on opening night. Having allowed Utah to get its first win while scoring 135 on 103 earlier in the week, the Bulls are one of three teams to have allowed more than 130 points per 100 possessions more than once.


The win in Atlanta on Saturday came with a rest advantage and with the Bulls playing 11 guys, eight of which scored in double-figures. They continue to rank in the top five in both ball and player movement.

The Bulls were one of five winless teams in the NBA Cup last season, and they’ll begin Cup play in Cleveland (where they’ve lost four straight) on Friday.

The Hawks got a nice win over the Knicks on Wednesday but followed that up with losses to the Pistons and Bulls.
Three takeaways

The win over New York came with a huge game (33 points, seven rebounds, three steals and two blocks) from Zaccharie Risacher, who had a huge bucket down the stretch when the Knicks doubled Trae Young. The Hawks’ lineup with Risacher in De’Andre Hunter’s place surpassed the 100-minute mark on Saturday and has allowed just 108.0 points per 100 possessions, the second-best mark among the 10 lineups that have played at least 100.


Losses to the Celtics and Bulls last week were just the 14th and 15th times in his career that Trae Young has played at least 20 minutes (444 games total, including Play-In and playoffs) and had zero free throw attempts. League-wide free throw rate (FTA/FGA) remains up and the Hawks have seen the fifth biggest jump as a team, but Young’s (38 attempts per 100 shots from the field) is down slightly from last season (40 per 100).


The Hawks have now played six of their l1 games against the other six Eastern Conference teams that didn’t make the playoffs last season, and they’re 2-4 (with four straight losses) in those games. They were just 11-11 within the bottom seven last season.

That 2-4 mark includes two losses to the Wizards, who the Hawks will host on Friday. Then they’ll embark on their first multi-game road trip of the season (four games over six days).

Before they got Devin Vassell back, the Spurs lost Jeremy Sochan to a broken thumb. They’ve also lost three of their last four games, including one they led by 26 points.
Three takeaways

The Spurs’ 26-point lead in LA on Monday was the largest for a losing team this season and the third largest for the Spurs in a game they lost in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data. They allowed the Clippers to score 99 points on 67 possessions (148 per 100) over the final 36 minutes, even though Victor Wembanyama had seven of his nine blocks over that stretch.


He had seven more blocks in the Spurs’ loss to the Jazz on Saturday, and would now be the first player to average at least four blocks per game since Dikembe Mutombo in 1995-96. When Wembanyama’s been off the floor, San Antonio opponents have shot 61.4% in the paint. When he’s been on the floor, that number is just 49.2%, including just 25-for-70 (35.7%) at the rim when he’s been there to protect it.


Vassell made his season debut on Saturday, scoring 21 points (on 8-for-13 shooting) in less than 22 minutes off the bench. With Sochan out of the lineup and Stephon Castle (or Vassell) in, the Spurs will have better spacing around Wembanyama, which should allow him to operate more near the basket. He’s still taken at least half of his shots from outside the paint in every game this season, with that rate a season-high 80% (12/15) on Saturday.

The Spurs were 0-4 in the NBA Cup last season, and their first Cup game this year will be against the team that was 7-0. Their game against the Lakers on Friday is also the end of a five-game homestand.

The Hornets had their first winning streak of the season, beating the Pistons and Pacers at home before losing in overtime in Philadelphia on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Brandon Miller had an eventful week, tipping in the game-winner against Detroit, catching fire (with 17 third-quarter points) against Indiana, and missing a 3 for the win in Philadelphia. The game-winner was a rare foray inside for the second-year wing, who has taken just 28% of his shots in the paint. He’s shot 84% from the free throw line in his career (15-for-16 this season), so more drives and more free throws would be helpful.


But the game-winner was representative of the Hornets’ improvement on the offensive glass. They’ve retained 33.8% of available offensive rebounds this season, the league’s fourth-highest rate and up from 24.3% (27th) last season. Mark Williams remains out and Nick Richards has missed the last five games, but Taj Gibson and Moussa Diabaté combined for as many offensive boards (8) as the Sixers (who have Andre Drummond) had on Sunday.


With Miles Bridges (bone bruise in his right knee) out the last two games, 19-year-old Tidjane Salaün has been in the starting lineup alongside the 39-year-old Gibson. The Hornets scored just 41 points on 50 offensive possessions with the frontline duo on the floor together over the weekend, and Charles Lee has leaned heavily on his bench. Over these last three games, Charlotte has outscored opponents by 45 points (26.2 per 100 possessions) in Cody Martin’s 87 minutes.

It’s not a bad time to be playing the Magic, and the Hornets will face them twice in the next 15 days. The first meeting is their NBA Cup opener in Orlando on Tuesday, after which Charlotte will have three full days off.

The Pistons have shown signs of progress and certainly aren’t where they were a year ago (eight games into a 28-game losing streak), but offense remains a struggle.
Three takeaways

Has Cade Cunningham arrived? The fourth-year guard recorded three straight triple-doubles last week, also making two huge plays down the stretch of the Pistons’ win over the Hawks on Friday. He followed up his deft, lefty go-ahead bucket with the game-saving block on Onyeka Okongwu at the buzzer after the Pistons had blown a 24-point lead.


The Pistons rank sixth in defensive rebounding percentage overall but haven’t had their best rebounder (Jalen Duren) for the last 2 1/2 games, and they got burned by some offensive boards down the stretch of their losses to the Hornets and Rockets. Malik Beasley whiffed on his last-second box-out in Charlotte on Wednesday, allowing Brandon Miller to slide by him for the game-winning tip-in. And they allowed seven clutch second-chance points in their two-point loss to Houston on Sunday afternoon.


The Pistons are one of the 10 teams that have scored more points per 100 possessions than they did last season (109.0, 27th), but have had some ugly offensive nights in the last couple of weeks, and turnovers continue to be an issue. Only the Jazz have committed more per 100 possessions.

The Pistons are one of seven teams with three stretches of five games in seven days this season. Their first begins Tuesday with their NBA Cup opener, a visit from the Heat. Cunningham and Jaden Ivey combined for nine of the team’s 17 turnovers in their loss in Miami in Week 2.

Over the last nine days, the Bucks have had fourth-quarter leads in three games against the two teams — the Cavs and Celtics — dominating the Eastern Conference. But they haven’t been able to finish the job and are still waiting for their breakthrough, with their only two wins having come against Philadelphia and Utah.
Three takeaways

The Bucks’ original starting lineup didn’t have bad numbers overall (plus-5.5 points per 100 possessions in 108 minutes), but Gary Trent Jr. has shot just 9-for-39 (23%) from 3-point range, also coming up short regarding the disruptive defense that he’s provided in the past. Trent has missed the last two games with back spasms, but he was first replaced by Andre Jackson. And with Jackson starting on Thursday, and the Bucks ran out to a 21-11 lead against the Jazz. Nine Bucks have played at least 50 minutes alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo, with the best on-court numbers among those eight Antetokounmpo combos (plus-7.2 points per 100 possessions in 86 total minutes) belonging to Jackson.


AJ Green has also been getting some run off the bench and has shot 18-for-27 (67%) from 3-point range over the last four games. All 38 of his shots this season have come from beyond the arc.


Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, has taken just 3% of his shots from 3-point range, with this being the fifth straight season in which he’s seen a drop in 3-point rate. He’s also passing the ball less, averaging just 5.4 assists per 36 minutes, his lowest rate in the last seven seasons. He’s passed on just 23.9% of his drives, down from 37.5% last season.

The Bucks still have two games left on their first stretch of five games in seven days, but their loss to the Celtics on Sunday began a stretch where they’re playing seven of eight at home.

Paul George made his Sixers debut last week, but Joel Embiid got suspended before he could return, and Tyrese Maxey suffered a hamstring injury on Wednesday. It’s still not clear when we’ll see all three on the floor together.
Three takeaways

George is clearly dealing with some rust, shooting just 39% (including 4-for-25 from 3-point range) over his four games while committing six turnovers in his debut. The Sixers scored just 100.4 points per 100 possessions in his 113 minutes on the floor, and they were outscored by 14 points (scoring 78 points on 80 possessions) in the 38 minutes that George and Maxey played together over two games.


The Sixers signed Andre Drummond to, hopefully, make their non-Embiid minutes (and games) not so bad, but they’ve been outscored by 19.8 points per 100 possessions in Drummond’s 235 minutes on the floor. That’s the fourth worst on-court mark (worst among non-Jazz players) among 256 players who’ve averaged at least 15 minutes in five games or more. Guerschon Yabusele closed both of their close games last week at the five and it will be fascinating to see who’s the back-up on Tuesday.


Where Embiid catches the ball and how much he’s operating in the paint (something affected by his energy level) will be critical to watch in his debut. The Sixers were a plus-14 in the restricted area in their overtime win over the Hornets on Sunday, but have still been outscored by 6.9 restricted-area points per game, the league’s sixth-worst discrepancy.

The Sixers’ NBA Cup game against the Knicks on Tuesday is the first night of a back-to-back, so we probably won’t see Embiid against the Cavs the following night. The Sixers have won their last seven games in Orlando, where they’ll begin a three-game trip on Friday.

The Raptors have dropped into last place in the Eastern Conference, having lost the first four games of their five-game trip.
Three takeaways

The Raptors have twice had double-digit leads with less than seven minutes left against the Nuggets, and they lost both games. RJ Barrett had a chance for redemption (after air-balling a 3-pointer one possession earlier) at the buzzer on Monday, but his step-back 3 for the win spun in and out. The Raptors are 3-for-14 (21%) on clutch 3s for the season, with Barrett 1-for-7.


With Scottie Barnes having missed the last seven games and Immanuel Quickley missing eight before returning over the weekend, Barrett is registering a career-high usage rate of 29.9%. This is the first time since his rookie year that he’s been assisted on less than half of his buckets, and his true shooting percentage (52.2%) is way down from his 32 games with the Raptors last season (61.5%).


The Raptors rank last in opponent free throw rate by a wide margin, with their opponents having attempted 38 free throws per 100 shots from the field. Over their six November games, they’ve attempted 83 fewer free throws than their opponents. And for the season, the difference at the line has been greater than or equal to the overall point differential in six of their nine losses.

Winless on their current trip and 0-6 away from Scotiabank Arena overall, the Raptors are the only team without a road win. They’ll try again when they open NBA Cup play in Milwaukee on Tuesday. Dating back to Game 5 of the 2019 conference finals, they’ve won seven of their last 10 games at Fiserv Forum.

The Blazers had shown some signs of progress, but the wheels may be coming off three games into their second stretch of five games in seven days. They lost their two weekend games by a total of 70 points.
Three takeaways

Matisse Thybulle remains out, but both Shaedon Sharpe and Robert Williams III made their season debuts last week. Sharpe (1-for-13 from 3-point range in his three games) replaced Deni Avdija in the starting lineup on Sunday, while Williams played 11 minutes alongside Donovan Clingan over the weekend. The Blazers allowed Minnesota and Memphis to score 41 points on 27 defensive possessions (1.52 per) in those 11 minutes.


The Blazers entered this season having lost nine of their last 10 games to the Pelicans, but they’re 2-1 vs. New Orleans this season (with the final meeting in January), having scored more than 128 points per 100 possessions in both of the wins and no more than 114 per 100 in any of their other nine games.


Delano Banton was the hero last Monday, not playing at all in the first three quarters and then scoring 20 points (on 8-for-9 shooting) as the Blazers won the fourth by 21. He proceeded to shoot 9-for-33 over the next three games, though the Blazers have still outscored their opponents by almost 14 points per 100 possessions in his 95 minutes this season.

Sharpe had a game-saving block as the Blazers won their first NBA Cup game (in overtime vs. Memphis) last year (then losing their next three by double-digits). They’ll begin Cup play on Tuesday with the first of two straight games against the Wolves.

The injuries continue to pile up for the Pelicans, who lost Jordan Hawkins (lower back strain) and Zion Williamson (hamstring strain) this week, already missing four other guys in their top six.
Three takeaways

Not coincidentally, the Pelicans have lost seven of their last eight games. But while the missing star power is the story, it’s on defense where they’re struggling. They’ve allowed 124.8 points per 100 possessions (3.6 more than any other team) over the 1-7 stretch. They now rank last in opponent effective field goal percentage and 29th in defensive rebounding percentage.


The Pelicans have been outscored by at least 10 points in the restricted area in nine of their 10 games total, with a season-worst differential of -46 (outscored 64-18) in Orlando on Friday.


Brandon Boston Jr. is one bright spot as he’s averaged 17.6 points on an effective field goal percentage of 60.5% over the Pelicans’ five November games. That includes 26 (one shy of his career high) on Friday when he was handling the ball quite a bit and improved to 10-for-17 (59%) from mid-range for the season.

The Pelicans could get (at least) one guy back this week as Trey Murphy III is listed as probable for their game against the Nets on Monday. After that, the schedule gets pretty rough for the next six games.

After an 0-6 start, the Jazz got off the schneid in Chicago (they just needed to play the Eastern Conference to get their first win), picking up another victory in San Antonio on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The win in Chicago came without Lauri Markkanen and with John Collins scoring 28 points (including a monster dunk over Coby White) off the bench, where he’s remained even with Utah’s two starting forwards (Markkanen and Taylor Hendricks) unavailable. Collins is averaging fewer minutes this season, but has career-high marks in both usage rate (26.3%) and assist ratio (14 per 100 possessions used).


The Jazz have been the league’s worst jump-shooting team, ranking last in mid-range field goal percentage (26.3%) and 26th in 3-point percentage (31.6%). But they’ve outscored their opponents by 5.7 points per game (the league’s third-best differential) at the free throw line (where Collins is 25-for-26). They were outscored by 27 from outside the paint in San Antonio, but were a plus-20 in the paint and a plus-8 at the line.


The Jazz have started two rookies in four of their last five games, with Cody Williams in the lineup since Hendricks’ injury, Kyle Filipowski replacing Markkanen for his three-game absence, and Isaiah Collier (two days after making his NBA debut) replacing Keyonte George (foot soreness) on Saturday. They rank third in the percentage of their minutes that have come from rookies or second-year players (36%) after ranking fifth (39%) last season.

The Jazz are in West Group B with the Lakers, Thunder, Suns and Spurs for the NBA Cup. They’ll open Cup action against Phoenix on Tuesday, Game 1 of a two-game homestand that’s sandwiched by two four-game trips.

Thank goodness for the Hawks, because without their two wins vs. Atlanta, the Wizards would have nothing but double-digit losses.
Three takeaways

Kyle Kuzma has missed the last five games. The first was the team’s best offensive game of the season (133 points on 106 possessions), with seven Wizards scoring in double-figures. But over their four-game losing streak, the Wizards have scored just 100.7 points per 100 possessions, shooting below 25% from 3-point range. That includes 1-for-16 from Corey Kispert, their best shooter.


Alex Sarr had a “welcome to the league” moment on Monday. On the Warriors’ very first possession, Sarr switched on to Stephen Curry and then abandoned the greatest shooter ever after he got rid of the ball. That was, of course, a mistake. Sarr does have decent rim protection numbers, with opponents having shot 34-for-59 (57.6%) at the rim when he’s been there.


Jonas Valančiūnas got his second start of the season on Friday, though the Wizards went back to Kyshawn George in the lineup (and Sarr at the five) for the second half and then again on Sunday. They’ve allowed 126.4 points per 100 possessions with Valančiūnas on the floor, with that being the second-worst on-court defensive mark among 300 players who’ve averaged at least 10 minutes per game.

Last season’s Wizards were the first team in 39 years to go winless (0-13) in the second game of back-to-backs. Their first chance for a win without rest this season is Monday in Houston, where the Wizards have won just one of their last seven games.

But there are some silver linings. Shaedon Sharpe scored 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting in his season debut against San Antonio. Anfernee Simons is averaging 2.7 threes per game. Rookie Donovan Clingan has the highest block percentage in the NBA.

Most importantly, despite a Wednesday loss the Sacramento Kings suppressing their numbers a bit, two of the available members of the young core have looked solid in expanded roles.

So, this lackluster start in the win-loss columns probably shouldn't be surprising.
On the bright side, all the absences have given Brandon Ingram a chance to juice his trade value. And by February, he may be able to generate enough interest to flip him for a starting-caliber center. On the season, Ingram is averaging 24.1 points, 4.6 assists and 2.4 threes."

He's averaging 19.9 points and 7.3 assists. Cameron Johnson is putting up 16.6 points and 2.0 threes. Dorian Finney-Smith is averaging double-figures.
There could be some teams out there interested in the playmaking of Schröder or the three-and-D prowess of Johnson or DFS. If the Nets can get some future draft capital or prospects (or both) for them, they should probably go for it.
On the other hand, Brooklyn has nine of its next 11 games on the road. One of those home games is against the Boston Celtics. The schedule alone could juice the lottery odds and delay the trade talk for a few weeks."

If this game serves as the confidence boost Risacher needed to start hitting his threes at an above-average clip, the Hawks should stay in the mix for a play-in spot all season.

Last season, the team's general lack of offense was a problem, but the bigger issue for that duo in 2024-25 is on the defensive end. Miami is surrendering 120.0 points per 100 possessions when both are on the floor.
Does that mean Tyler Herro should go back to being a heat-check scorer off the bench? Is it time to take Nikola Jović out of his token starter role (he played five minutes in the last lass and just 12 in the one before that)?

But none of that would mean much if Sacramento was losing games or that trio's minutes. It's early, but the Kings are plus-15.7 points per 100 possessions when those three stars are on the floor."

The Denver Nuggets got off to a shaky 0-2 start. They seem genuinely averse to comfortable victories (two came in overtime and four have finished with margins of victory within five points). Jamal Murray (concussion) and Aaron Gordon (calf strain) have both missed time.
But this stretch could be pretty important in the long run. Russell Westbrook is getting extended minutes alongside Nikola Jokić, and the young players who have been such an important component of Calvin Booth's team-building strategy are picking up valuable experience in clutch time.
In Wednesday's 124-122 upset over the Oklahoma City Thunder, Christian Braun had 24 points and eight rebounds. Peyton Watson had the game-winning block on Shai Gilgeous-Alexander as time expired.
But come on, Denver being on pace for 50 wins despite some early bumps on the road is a credit to Jokic. He's surged into first place in Basketball Reference's MVP Tracker thanks to his video-game averages of 28.8 points, 13.5 rebounds, 11.0 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.3 blocks."

Following the Minnesota Timberwolves' late offseason trade of Karl-Anthony Towns, there was some understandable concern about a potential lack of spacing in lineups with Rudy Gobert and Julius Randle.
Will there be enough room for Anthony Edwards' slashing on these post-KAT T-Wolves?
Turns out, Edwards was willing to tackle the consternation himself. In Thursday's blowout win over the Chicago Bulls, he went 5-of-9 from deep, bringing his season-long average to 5.1 per game.
In other words, he's on pace to break Stephen Curry's all-time record of 402 threes in a single season.
Still, Minnesota's offense is barely above average when Edwards is on the floor. There are still some issues to work through for the revamped Timberwolves. But Ant's shooting will help them keep winning while they try to figure out the spacing."

Through eight games, his averages for points (28.6), rebounds (8.1) and assists (8.1) are down from last season, and he's shooting just 45.5 percent on twos and 32.9 percent from deep.

Kevin Durant has eclipsed 30 points five times this season. He's averaging 27.8 points, 3.4 assists and 2.6 threes, and he's currently rocking a 62.2 effective field-goal percentage.
If those marks hold, he'll have his 12th season with 500-plus minutes, 25-plus points per game and a 55-plus effective field-goal percentage. That would be an all-time high (unless LeBron also secures his 12th such campaign in 2024-25)."

There was some chatter during the Golden State Warriors' 6-1 start about the schedule being soft. And it was fair. Five of those wins came against the Portland Trail Blazers, Utah Jazz, New Orleans Pelicans and Washington Wizards.
But they made a statement on Wednesday by beating the Boston Celtics (in Boston) behind 27 points and nine assists from Stephen Curry. And oh yeah, Curry missed three of those wins with an injury.
So, even if some of their early opponents are likely to finish the season below .500, there are plenty of signs that Golden State might just be a contender again.
The depth of this team looks stout, with almost all of their offseason acquisitions making positive contributions. Youngsters Brandin Podziemski, Trayce Jackson-Davis and Moses Moody have all shown hints of continuing development. And perhaps most importantly, Buddy Hield looks ready to more than make up for the loss of Klay Thompson.
He had 16 points in Wednesday's win, and it was one of his quietest performances of the season. On the year, he's averaging 21.1 points (barely shy of Curry's 21.2), 4.6 threes and 2.3 assists while shooting 50.7 percent from deep."

All the key indicators for OKC are still pointing to a deep playoff run.
The 96.5 points per 100 possessions they're allowing gives them the best defensive rating in the league by a whopping 7.3 points. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is once again playing like an MVP candidate. Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren are both playing, at the very least, like fringe All-Stars. Their depth looks strong (the team is winning the non-SGA minutes).

There have been stretches of this season when the Boston Celtics looked borderline unbeatable.
They crushed the New York Knicks on opening night. Five of their seven wins have been by double-digits. One of the losses took overtime. And they're connecting on a whopping 19.0 threes per game.
But they're starting to show some hints of mortality, with losses to the Indiana Pacers and Golden State Warriors over the last week and change.
And while it's easy to point to the absence of Jaylen Brown against Golden State and Kristaps Porziņģis for both losses, it's fair to have some concern about the games when the threes aren't pouring in.
Boston should have the talent to adjust and do more damage inside, when necessary, but waiting too long to make that change could be costly in a playoff game.
Is this all pretty nitpicky? Yeah. But the Celtics have been good enough to take genuine worries off the table."

All their best veterans (Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, Collin Sexton and Jordan Clarkson) played and scored in double figures. And in games when all four are available, they can at least compete with most teams.
That's why it's hard to imagine this roster staying intact throughout the season. In 2022-23, Utah unloaded Mike Conley at the deadline. The next year, it was Kelly Olynyk. This February, Collins and Sexton should be available. Even the soon-to-be-26-year-old Sexton could be too.

At a certain point, though, you have to acknowledge the losses. And Toronto just went 0-5 on a five-game road trip. And not long before that, it had another four-game losing streak.

If they stay there, they aren't likely to find a potential franchise-changer in the 2025 draft. In fact, if their pick winds up outside the top 10, it goes to the San Antonio Spurs.

All told, the 20-year-old is averaging 36.0 points, 12.0 rebounds, 6.7 threes and 4.3 blocks over his last three appearances.
And while Wembanyama is not likely to produce at that level for the rest of this season, being anywhere near there would keep the Spurs in the play-in mix for the foreseeable future."

The start of Tyrese Haliburton's 2024-25 campaign has been an adventure, and not often the fun kind.
After he went for nine points on 3-of-14 shooting in the Indiana Pacers' Wednesday loss to the Orlando Magic, Haliburton is now averaging 16.0 points on 39.1 percent shooting (including 27.1 percent from deep).
And if he doesn't break out of this slump (which seems to extend back to an injury in January) soon, it's hard to imagine Indiana being any better than an around-.500 team.
In the meantime, the Pacers have Haliburton's supporting cast to thank for keeping competitive.

There is plenty of understandable concern surrounding the Milwaukee Bucks.
They've lost twice as many games as they've won. Damian Lillard is 34 years old and missing games in concussion protocol. They've underwhelmed in every playoff run since winning the title in 2021. Khris Middleton is still out from multiple offseason ankle surgeries. And offseason additions Taurean Prince, Gary Trent Jr. and Delon Wright haven't really moved the needle in the right direction.
But as long as they have Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks feel like a threat to beat just about anyone on just about any night.
He willed Milwaukee to victory on Wednesday, when he had 59 of his team's 127 points. And for the season, he's averaging 33.3 points, 12.1 rebounds and 5.5 assists."

The New York Knicks' head-scratching 2024-25 campaign continued this week, which included losses to a pair of sub-.500 teams (the Indiana Pacers and Chicago Bulls) and wins over Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid.
And despite being under .500 themselves, New York is still in the top 10 in net rating.
So, instead of worrying about the losses, we'll assume the Knicks' record will eventually start catching up to the point differential. And that's not all difficult to imagine when Karl-Anthony Towns is playing like he did on Wednesday.
It came in a loss, but Towns had 46 points and six threes against the Chicago Bulls. And if he stays anywhere near his current production level (26.5 points, 12.2 rebounds and 2.7 assists) after Jalen Brunson returns to his MVP candidate form, the wins should start adding up."

The third-leading scorer, Klay Thompson, is barely averaging more points (14.8) than shot attempts (13.0) per game. The only other double-figures scorer, Daniel Gafford, is losing his minutes so far this season. And Naji Marshall's three-point shot hasn't shown up yet. He's just 4-of-25 from deep so far.

It's fair to be a little worried about the Minnesota Timberwolves.
It's not just that they're at an even .500 through 12 games, though that's worse than expected. It's not just that they're coming off three straight losses and back-to-back defeats to the Portland Trail Blazers, though that would have seemed unthinkable a month ago.
The biggest concern may well be how poorly Julius Randle is fitting alongside Anthony Edwards and Rudy Gobert.
All of the fears that accompanied him to Minnesota after the Karl-Anthony Towns trade are proving warranted. His tendency to hold the ball too long is stifling movement and potentially taking possessions from Edwards. The lack of respect commanded by his jumper is shrinking the floor when he's on it with Gobert.
When Randle is on the court, Minnesota is plus-0.8 points per 100 possessions. It's plus-7.7 when he's off.
Similar swings were a characteristic of much of Randle's time with the New York Knicks, and the Timberwolves might need to start thinking about some dramatic changes to avoid continuing the trend.
Trades or even a move to the bench should at least be on the table."

And if you're among the more pessimistic persuasion of NBA fans, 8-10 weeks before getting a protocol for a return means Holmgren could be months away from in-game action.
It's obviously a huge loss for the Thunder. The 2022 No. 2 pick is the anchor of the league's best defense and arguably OKC's second-best player. The disadvantages of being without him are even more pronounced with Isaiah Hartenstein also out.
But the Thunder are uniquely capable of winning games playing small-ball until Hartenstein returns, which could happen within a few weeks now.
With the floor completely spread out, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander should be able to dominate driving lanes. That'll help Jalen Williams, too. And though a lack of rebounding and rim protection will hurt, they survived missing the former on the way to 57 wins in 2023-24."

And while it's more than fair to point out that Cleveland has had one of the easiest schedules in the league to this point, it does have wins over the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers. And both were blowouts.

Against a relatively weak schedule over the last nine days, the Cavs haven’t been particularly dominant. Each of their last five games have been within two points in the fourth quarter and four of the five were within five points in the last five minutes. For the season, they’ve scored a remarkable 82 points on 55 clutch possessions (149 per 100), with Darius Garland having shot 12-for-15 on clutch shots.


They did win weekend games without Evan Mobley (Friday vs. Chicago) and Donovan Mitchell (Sunday vs. Charlotte). Ty Jerome was the replacement starter against the Hornets, scored 24 points on 9-for-15 shooting, and is one of four Cavs in the top 15 in effective field goal percentage among 152 players with at least 100 field goal attempts.


The Cavs have played the league’s easiest schedule in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage (.395), with 10 of their 15 games coming against teams no better than the 5-8 Hornets. Twelve of the 15 have come against teams that rank in the bottom half of the league defensively.

15-0 is still 15-0, but the Cavs will face their toughest test when they visit the Celtics in NBA Cup action on Tuesday. They actually made only six fewer 3-pointers than Boston (but were outscored by 30 points at the free-throw line) over their five-game series in May, when the Cavs were without Jarrett Allen all series and without Donovan Mitchell for the final two games.

They had a 16-0, third-quarter run against Dallas on Tuesday, and they took control of their game against Memphis with a big third quarter on Friday.

Three of the four games without Holmgren have been three of the 13 games this season in which a team has grabbed less than 57% of available defensive rebounds. The Thunder have been a worse-than-average defensive-rebounding team (68%) with Holmgren on the floor and even worse (64.6%) with him off the floor.


Their defensive rebounding percentage has been the lowest (55.9%) with Kenrich Williams on the floor, but Williams (backing up Jalen Williams at the five) has retained his plus-minus magic after missing the first 10 games of the season. He had three steals and four blocks in 53 total minutes last week, with the Thunder outscoring their opponents by 25 points (allowing just 95 per 100 possessions) in those 53 minutes.


If they can’t rebound, the Thunder can force more turnovers, and they committed 44 fewer turnovers than their opponents over their four games last week. Their opponent turnover rate (19.4 per 100 possessions) leads the league by a huge margin and would be the highest mark in the last 26 seasons.

The Thunder (3-0) are one of two teams – the Cavs are the other – with three wins in the second games of back-to-backs, and this week brings back-to-back No. 4, which will be followed by four days off.

The Wolves haven’t had much consistency on either end of the floor. With their starters combining to shoot 13-for-64 (20%) from 3-point range, they scored less than a point per possession over their three-game losing streak. But they won their two weekend games despite allowing at least 120 per 100 on both nights


After their struggles over the previous three games, five different Wolves made at least five 3-pointers over the weekend wins. For the season, they’ve taken 48.2% of their shots from 3-point range (third highest), up from 38.4% (17th) last season, with that being the league’s third biggest jump.


A lot of that, of course, is Anthony Edwards, whose 3-point rate has gone from 34.1% to 53.7%. He leads the league with 43 pull-up 3s, with his 41.3% on pull-up 3s ranking fourth among 21 players with at least 50 attempts.

The Wolves have three days off to enjoy the weekend wins before embarking on a two-game trip through Toronto and Boston. Both of their meetings with the Celtics last season went to overtime, with the home team winning both games.

After losing four straight games by a total of eight points, the Mavs went 2-0 over the weekend, picking up their best win of the season in Oklahoma City on Sunday night.
Three takeaways

The Mavs were without Luka Dončić on Sunday, but ended their streak of six straight losses in clutch games, escaping with a win (when Lu Dort missed a desperation 3 at the buzzer) after blowing almost all of a 14-point, fourth-quarter lead. For the season, they’ve allowed 71 points on 54 clutch possessions (131 per 100).


But without Dončić, they scored 121 points on 97 possessions against the league’s No. 1 defense, getting to the line for 36 free throws and shooting 11-for-27 (41%) from 3-point range. That ended an amazing streak of six straight games where they shot no better than 33% from deep. Kyrie Irving hasn’t been the problem and is still shooting better than 50% (38-for-73) from 3-point range.


The Mavs needed a big offensive game because they’ve allowed 14.5 more points per 100 possessions on the road (119.3, 28th) than they have at home (104.8, third best). That’s tied for the second-biggest home-road differential on either end of the floor.

It’s tied with the Pelicans’ offense, which has been 14.5 points per 100 possessions better at home. And the Mavs will host the shorthanded Pels on Tuesday before heading out on a three-game trip that takes them from Denver to Miami.

The Nuggets have won their last five (and seven of their last eight) games with Nikola Jokić in uniform. But the three-time MVP missed both of their games last week for personal reasons and, unsurprisingly, the Nuggets lost them both.
Three takeaways

Prior to Friday, the Nuggets had scored just 81 points per 100 possessions with Jokić off the floor. So the 96.3 per 100 they scored over the two weekend losses was an improvement, though still rather anemic offense, especially when you consider that the Pelicans ranked 29th defensively prior to the Friday game.


Jamal Murray shot just 12-for-31 (including 3-for-14 from 3-point range) and had just two free throw attempts over the two losses. He’s registering career-low marks for both 2-point percentage (45.9%) and 3-point percentage (30.2%).


Though the starting center was Dario Šarić and not Jokic, Denver was still much better with the starting center on the floor (plus-7.0 points per 100 possessions) than it was with him off the floor (minus-49.4) over the two games. The Nuggets’ aggregate bench NetRtg (minus-8.1 points per 100 possessions) would be the worst benchmark in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data.

Over the last five seasons (since his first MVP season), the Nuggets are 9-17 without Jokic. Hopefully, he’ll be available for their second of two games in Memphis (Tuesday).

The Lakers haven’t been dominant, but they’ve won five straight games and remain undefeated (8-0) in the NBA Cup all-time.
Three takeaways

The winning streak coincides with Cam Reddish replacing D’Angelo Russell in the starting lineup. That change also sparked LeBron James’ career-long streak of four straight triple-doubles, which came to an end in New Orleans on Saturday (when Reddish was also out). James’ 41 assists to Anthony Davis are the most from a player to a single teammate, but he had at least two assists to each of the other 10 Lakers that he shared the floor with over the four-game, triple-double streak.


The last three games were all within five points in the last five minutes. The Lakers scored 43 points on 26 clutch possessions (1.65 per) over the three, with James, Davis and Austin Reaves combining to shoot 7-for-10 on clutch 3-pointers. James was 1-for-6 from beyond the arc before draining the dagger over Yves Missi on Saturday.


Overall, the Lakers rank as the league’s fourth most-improved offensive team, having scored 2.3 more points per 100 possessions than they did last season. They’ve seen the league’s third-biggest drop in turnover rate and its sixth-biggest jump in offensive rebounding percentage.

The Lakers are 6-0 at home and return to Staples Center for a three-game homestand that includes a visit from the Magic, the best defensive team they will have faced thus far.

Ja Morant has missed the last five games, but the Grizzlies got Marcus Smart, Desmond Bane and Vince Williams Jr. back from injury absences last week and remained above .500 with a win over the shorthanded Nuggets on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Seven of the Grizzlies’ eight wins have come by 13 points or more, while four of their six losses have come by five points or fewer. So they’re 8-2 with the point differential (plus-7.7 per game, fourth in the West) of a team that’s 11-3. They have played a relatively soft schedule (sixth lowest cumulative opponent winning percentage) and they were down 21 with less than four minutes left before making a too-late comeback to pull within five at Golden State on Friday.


Bane shot just 2-for-11 from 3-point range in his first two games back, but was 10-for-14 inside the arc, adding 11 rebounds and seven assists in the win over Denver. The Grizzlies have still had Bane, Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. on the floor together for just 18 total minutes over two games.


Bane’s stronger shooting inside the arc is emblematic of a team that’s averaged 59.9 points in the paint per game, which would be the highest mark in the 29 seasons for which shot locations have been tracked. Their paint differential (plus-13.1 points per game) would be the second biggest in that time.

The Grizzlies’ win over the Nuggets on Sunday was the start of a stretch where they’re playing seven of eight at home, and they’ll have a rest advantage for the one road game (Saturday in Chicago).

De’Aaron Fox had a pretty good weekend, totaling 109 points against the Wolves and Jazz. But the Kings split the two games, because their defense wasn’t good enough, especially in the clutch on Friday.
Three takeaways

Fox ranks third in transition possessions per game (6.3), according to Synergy tracking. He hasn’t been very efficient in transition, scoring just 0.89 points per possession, down from 1.16 last season and the second worst mark among 32 players with at least 50 transition possessions total. But in scoring a career-high 60 points on Friday, Fox (14 on 10 possessions) outscored the entire Wolves team (five on nine) by nine points in transition. For the second straight season, the Kings lead the league in the (lowest) percentage of their opponents’ possessions (12.9%) that have been in transition.


The transition defense is the biggest reason why the Kings are one of two teams – the Bucks are the other – that rank in the top five in both opponent field goal percentage in the paint (53.0%, fourth) and the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come in the paint (45%, fourth lowest). But as they allowed Minnesota to score 28 points on 20 clutch possessions in the loss on Friday, the biggest damage came with two straight Anthony Edwards drives for 3-point plays in the final two minutes of regulation.


Malik Monk has missed the last four games, DeMar DeRozan has missed the last two, and Domantas Sabonis was out against Utah on Saturday. So the Kings’ bench has been pretty depleted, though they were still at their best with reserves on the floor last week.

The Kings are 0-1 in NBA Cup play, but still have a great opportunity to qualify for the semifinals because the loss was in overtime and comes with a point differential of zero. Their next Cup game is Friday when they’ll visit the Clippers, to whom they lost (at home) in Week 3, shooting just 3-for-26 from 3-point range.

The Suns are 1-4 without Kevin Durant, with the only win having come against the last-place Jazz.
Three takeaways

The Suns had 40 free throw attempts in Oklahoma City on Friday, but the loss was still their worst offensive performance (83 points on 96 possessions) in the last five seasons. Their effective field goal percentage of 35.3% was the lowest mark for any team in any game this season. Devin Booker was 2-for-10 (0-for-6 in the first half) and his season-long effective field goal percentage of 51.0% would be his lowest mark in the last seven seasons.


Overall, the bigger difference from their games with Durant in uniform has been on defense, where the Suns have allowed 117.9 points per 100 possessions over these last five games. Sandwiching the Oklahoma City loss were games in which the Kings and Wolves combined to shoot 66% inside the arc and 48% from deep.


Bradley Beal has also missed the last three games, and the Suns have now been outscored by 8.9 points per 100 possessions in 174 minutes with Booker on the floor without either Beal or Durant. They started both Mason Plumlee and Jusuf Nurkić on Sunday and were actually a plus-5 in less than 10 minutes with the two bigs on the floor together.

The Suns’ rest-disadvantage game against the Magic on Monday is the end of their first stretch of five games in seven days. But it’s also the start of their longest homestand of the season (six games over 16 days), with a five-day break after their game against the Knicks on Wednesday.

The Knicks have been within one game of .500 all season, but they’re now on the right side of .500 for the first time since they were 3-2, having swept their two-game series with the Nets over the weekend.
Three takeaways

Prior to Friday, New York opponents had shot 62.0% (the league’s highest opponent mark) in the paint. But the Nets shot just 26-for-64 (41%) in the paint over the weekend, with Ariel Hukporti (playing 30 minutes with Karl-Anthony Towns out) blocking four shots on Friday when Mikal Bridges sealed the win by blocking Dennis Schröder at the buzzer.


The Knicks added a couple of guys who can get buckets in the offseason, but Jalen Brunson has a higher usage rate in the clutch (39.6%, fifth in the league) than he did last season (37.5%, third). He’s 3-for-5 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime, with all three makes (plus a miss for the win against Chicago) having come last week. The three makes are tied with Kevin Durant (3-for-5) and Jayson Tatum (3-for-6) for the league lead.


Overall, Brunson has an effective field goal percentage of just 51.5%, the lowest mark of his career, though not a huge drop from the last two seasons (54.5%). That’s mostly about his shooting from outside the paint; His shooting in the paint (56.5%) is up from the last two years (54.5%) and he’s also registering the highest free throw rate of his career (36 attempts per 100 shots from the field).

The Knicks conclude their first stretch of five games in seven days with a visit from the Wizards on Monday. They then head out on a five-game trip where the first four games are against the Western Conference. They were 6-9 in West arenas last season and lost in Houston earlier this month.

After losing their first four games without Paolo Banchero (all on the road), the Magic have won five straight (all at home) to join the exclusive group of Eastern Conference teams with winning records.
Three takeaways

The Magic have held their opponents to just 92.9 points per 100 possessions over the winning streak. That’s 6.7 per 100 fewer than they allowed in any five-game stretch last season, with the context being that four of the five opponents (all except the Pacers) rank in the bottom eight offensively.


They’re not all bad offensive rebounding teams, but the Magic have continued to dominate the defensive glass, even though their two leading rebounders have both been out for all but nine minutes over the last nine games. Their season-long defensive rebounding percentage of 75.8% would be the highest mark for any team in the last four seasons.


Franz Wagner has averaged 28.4 points over the winning streak. He’s starting to make some shots from beyond the arc (5-for-11 on Friday), but his season-long true shooting percentage (56.7%) is still down from last season (57.5%) and ranks just 33rd among 43 players averaging at least 20 points per game. His field goal percentage in the paint and his free throw rate are both down from last season.

Now 7-0 at home, the Magic head back on the road this week, taking a three-game trip through the Pacific Division. They scored less than 90 points per 100 possessions in their last two games in Western Conference arenas.

The Pacers have been without Andrew Nembhard (last five games) and Aaron Nesmith (last seven), but there aren’t many teams feeling sorry for them these days. They did manage a split of two games against the Heat, holding off a Miami comeback on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Pacers are 4-3 over the last two weeks, having scored 127 points per 100 possessions over the four wins and just 97.6 over the three losses. Tyrese Haliburton has had the biggest true-shooting-percentage differential over that stretch, 67.8% in the wins and just 40.9% in the losses, also registering a much higher assist/turnover ratio and a much higher free throw rate in the wins.


Overall, the Pacers have seen the league’s third-biggest drop in points scored per 100 possessions from last season, when they ranked second on that end of the floor. Their shooting has seen a huge drop-off from mid-range, from 50.5% (the highest mark in the last 27 seasons of shot-location data) to just 35.4% (26th) this season.


With Ben Sheppard leaving Sunday’s win with an oblique strain, the Pacers are probably down another guard/wing this week. They closed the win over Miami with Haliburton and T.J. McConnell on the floor together, and that combo had great numbers (plus-17.7 per 100 possessions) in limited (220) minutes last season.

Counting their first-round playoff series, the Pacers were 8-3 against the Bucks last season. Their first meeting of ’24-25 is another NBA Cup game in Milwaukee on Friday.

The Clippers followed a four-game winning streak with three straight losses (all on the road) before coming back home to beat the Jazz on Sunday.
Three takeaways

After their defense got torched in Oklahoma City, the Clippers scored just 101.5 points per 100 possessions over their two losses in Houston. Norman Powell (8-for-29 over the two Houston games) finally cooled off and the Clips have now seen the league’s fifth-biggest drop in points scored per 100 possessions (-6.9) from last season.


The Clippers made a lineup change last week, replacing Terance Mann with Kris Dunn for the last three games. Mann has really struggled offensively, shooting just 40%, including 11-for-47 (23%) from outside the restricted area. He’s averaged just 16.6 minutes in his three games coming off the bench.


In Dunn’s first start, the new lineup outscored the Rockets by 15 points in a little less than 17 minutes, but Houston put the game out of reach with a 19-2 run spanning the third and fourth quarters and the Clippers were outscored by 23 in 31 total minutes with at least one reserve on the floor. Overall, the Clips are plus-12.8 points per 100 possessions in 92 minutes with Dunn on the floor with James Harden, Powell and Ivica Zubac.

The next five games might be the Clippers’ toughest stretch of the season, and they’ll be at a rest disadvantage when they host the Warriors on Monday. But they are one of two teams – the Cavs are the other – to have beaten Golden State.

Since an 0-4 start, the Pistons are 7-4, climbing to fifth place in the Eastern Conference. They’re also one of five 2-0 teams in the NBA Cup.
Three takeaways

The Pistons rank sixth defensively (fifth over the last 11 games), having held the Raptors and Wizards to just 99 points per 100 possessions over the weekend. While those are two pretty weak offenses, the Pistons have played more games against teams that rank in the top 10 offensively (5) than against teams that rank in the bottom 10 (3).


Malik Beasley has caught fire, shooting 27-for-56 (48%) from 3-point range over the last five games. A couple of possessions before he drained the game-winning free throw (after the Heat called a timeout they didn’t have) on Tuesday, he drained a huge 3 (on the move) to tie the game in the final minute of overtime.


Beasley has been in the starting lineup with Tim Hardaway Jr.’s absence, which has also provided an opportunity for third-year guard Wendell Moore Jr., who’s had more games of at least 20 minutes in the last five days (3) than he had prior in his career (1). Of course, we may soon see the season debut of Ausar Thompson, who was cleared to resume basketball activities last week. Thompson’s 2.89 steals + blocks per 36 minutes last season ranked 26th among 265 players who played at least 1,000 minutes.

The Heat went 2-4 on the first of two six-game road trips, 0-2 with Jimmy Butler and 2-2 without him.
Three takeaways

Two nights after a great play call for a game-winning layup, the Heat had one of the biggest sideline errors we’ve seen in a long time. After a brutal defensive breakdown (on a very common end-of-game play), a frustrated Erik Spoelstra called a timeout that they didn’t have and cost them their game in Detroit on Tuesday. The Heat are just 2-5 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, having allowed 72 points on 57 clutch possessions (1.26 per).


Bam Adebayo has averaged 24.7 points over the last three games, starting to see some jumpers fall (4-for-7 from mid-range and 5-for-8 from beyond the arc), but also starting to finish better in the paint. His season-long field goal percentage in the paint (49.2%), the percentage of his shots that have come in the paint (70%), and his free throw rate (37.1 attempts per 100 shots from the field) are all the lowest marks of his career.


Butler could return this week, though Jaime Jaquez Jr. was lost to a right ankle turn in the third quarter on Sunday. Kevin Love has started the last four games and the most recent lineup (with Haywood Highsmith in Butler’s place) has allowed less than a point per possession in its 45 minutes. But Love has played just 47 total minutes (ninth on the team) in that stretch, with Duncan Robinson or Nikola Jović on the floor late in the three games that were close.

Their loss in Indiana on Sunday was the end of a six-game trip and also the start of the Heat’s first back-to-back (they were the only team that hadn’t played one yet). The back end (a visit from the Sixers on Monday night) is followed by five days off.

Victor Wembanyama totaled 84 points (with a career-high 50 on Wednesday) as the Spurs picked up wins over the Kings and Wizards to get back to .500. But they’ve since dropped two straight.
Three takeaways

Wembanyama continues to take more than half of his shots from outside the paint, but those shots were falling (5-for-9 from mid-range, 14-for-28 from 3-point range) against Sacramento and Washington. Of course, in the paint, he’s shot 58-for-79 (73.4%), the best mark among 71 players with at least 75 attempts. He was 7-for-9 in the paint against the Lakers on Friday, but 5-for-16 from the outside (air-balling a late 3 for the lead) and didn’t attempt a single free throw in the five-point loss.


The Spurs are running a lot of actions (pick-and-rolls, inverted pick-and-rolls, dribble-handoffs) with Chris Paul and Wembanyama, who spend most of their minutes on the floor together. There was also some success with Wembanyama handing to Devin Vassell out of the left corner late in the Lakers’ loss, though Vassell has played just 18 of his 90 minutes with both Paul and Wembanyama also on the floor.


With Jeremy Sochan hurt and Vassell coming off the bench, Stephon Castle continues to start and play pretty well. The Spurs’ current lineup has outscored opponents by an amazing 58 points (35.7 per 100 possessions) in 76 total minutes, with some help from the opponents having shot just 13-for-56 (23%) from 3-point range in that time. It was a plus-12 in a little less than 12 minutes in their five-point loss to the Lakers.

Both Wembanyama and Vassell sat out the Spurs’ loss in Dallas on Saturday, the second game of a back-to-back. They don’t have a back-to-back this week, but they do have two of the best teams in the league – the Thunder and Warriors – coming to the Frost Bank Center. The Spurs’ first game against Oklahoma City is tied with the Wembanyama-less Dallas loss for their worst offensive performance (93 points on 100 possessions) of the season.

The Hawks got their best win of the season on Tuesday, beating the Celtics (in Boston) on Onyeka Okongwu’s tip-in with 6.1 seconds left. They also got their first win over the Wizards in three tries but began a four-game trip by blowing a 16-point lead in Portland.
Three takeaways

The Hawks won in Boston without Trae Young and with Jalen Johnson continuing to get more opportunities as a playmaker. He recorded his second career triple-double (18 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists) and has now had the ball in his hands for 3.9 minutes per game (11% of his time on the floor), up from 2.4 minutes (7%) last season.


Dyson Daniels has also made a pretty incredible leap, averaging 16.1 points per 36 minutes, up from 9.4 last season. His streak of four straight games with a least six steals came to an end in Portland on Sunday, but his 7.9 deflections per 36 minutes would easily be the highest rate in the nine seasons for which deflections have been tracked.


The Hawks also won in Boston despite being outscored by 24 points from 3-point range. For the season, they’ve been outscored by 12.6 points per game from beyond the arc, which would be the worst differential in the 45 seasons of the 3-point line. The 16.5 3s per game they’ve allowed would also be an NBA record by a wide margin, with the previous record being 14.8 per game.

Daniels didn’t play when the Hawks lost to the Kings earlier this month. Their four-game trip continues with a rest-disadvantage game in Sacramento on Monday.

The Nets have fallen victim to a pretty brutal schedule over the last 10 days. They’ve lost five of their last six games, with the only win coming by two points over the depleted Pelicans.
Three takeaways

After allowing just 110 points per 100 possessions over their previous seven games, the Nets played three games against the league’s second and third-ranked offenses and allowed almost 132 per 100 as they lost all three. Overall, they’ve seen the league’s sixth-biggest jump in points allowed per 100 possessions from last season, though it should be noted that seven of their 14 games have now come against teams that currently rank in the top seven offensively.


The Nets were also missing Nic Claxton over the weekend. Their most-used four-man unit – Dennis Schröder, Cam Thomas, Cam Johnson and Dorian Finney-Smith – has outscored opponents by 7.6 points per 100 possessions in 228 total minutes. That breaks down to a minus-5.4 per 100 in 85 minutes with Ben Simmons as the fifth guy and plus-15.7 per 100 in 143 minutes with somebody else as the fifth guy, with the difference almost entirely about the offensive end of the floor.


Four nights after hitting a tough, step-back 3 for the lead in New Orleans, Thomas gave the Nets a chance in their first of two games in New York by scoring 43 points on 16-for-22 shooting, with 15 of those 22 shots having come from outside the paint. Thomas has scored 1.29 points per possession in isolation, according to Synergy tracking, with only Kyrie Irving having a better mark (1.37) among 39 players with at least 25 total isolation possessions.

The Nets are six games into a stretch where they’re playing nine of 11 on the road. They’ll have two days off after hosting the Hornets on Tuesday, but then head out on a four-game trip that includes two more games against teams – the Kings and Warriors – that rank in the top 10 offensively.

The Blazers were the last team to play an interconference game, but good things come to those who wait, and they beat the Hawks on Sunday to give them three straight wins for the first time since Games 4-6 last season.
Three takeaways

It was just eight days ago that the Blazers were embarrassed by a 45-point loss (at home) to the shorthanded Grizzlies. And they responded well, with the winning streak being their best three-game stretch of defense (105.0 points allowed per 100 possessions) this season.


Shaedon Sharpe had played in just three games (and shot 1-for-13 from 3-point range) prior to the streak, but he’s been the offensive star, averaging 27.3 points on an effective field goal percentage of 58.5% over three wins. He also made some good decisions as he dished out five assists in the comeback win over the Hawks. If Sharpe could start putting it together (with some consistency) this season, he’d have a special combination of skill and athleticism.


Deandre Ayton has missed all three games, allowing Donovan Clingan (17 points, 12 rebounds and eight blocks in the second win over the Wolves) to start and Robert Williams III to play 50 minutes over the two games for which he was available. Williams totaled 33 points (on 15-for-16 shooting), 17 rebounds, four steals and four blocks in those 50 minutes.

The Blazers begin a five-game trip on Wednesday in Oklahoma City, where they lost by 62 points back in January. They also lost to the Thunder (at home) by 23 points earlier this month.

The Hornets got a clutch win over the Bucks (thanks to a phantom call) on Saturday and were somewhat competitive in a rest-disadvantage game in Cleveland the following night.
Three takeaways

Mark Williams hasn’t played, Nick Richards has missed the last eight games, and the Hornets have been outscored by 19.1 points per 100 possessions with Taj Gibson on the floor. So Grant Williams is now the starting center, backed up by Moussa Diabaté. The Williams lineup has shot 25-for-47 (53%) from 3-point range but has also allowed 129 points on just 95 defensive possessions (136 per 100).


Diabaté, meanwhile, had four straight games of double-digit rebounds off the bench. He had 10 offensive boards in less than 25 minutes on Saturday when the Hornets outscored the Bucks by 13 points (21-8) on second chances. He ranks second (behind Kevon Looney) in both offensive rebounding percentage and total rebounding percentage among 276 players who’ve averaged at least 15 minutes per game.


LaMelo Ball hit the two free throws to put the Hornets ahead after the phantom call on Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Hornets are 32-for-34 on clutch free throws and Ball is the league’s leading fourth-quarter scorer at 11.2 points per game. He has an effective field goal percentage of 67.2% in the fourth quarter and just 47.7% otherwise.

It’s hard to know which of the Eastern Conference teams within a few games of .500 might actually be solid, but the Hornets have three good tests of where they stand this week. They’ll visit the Nets and Bucks, with a home game against the Pistons (who they beat the buzzer 12 days ago) in between.

The Bulls got a good win in New York on Wednesday, with Coby White going 3-for-3 at the line to put them ahead with 3.2 seconds left. But they proceeded to allow more than 140 points in both games over the weekend.
Three takeaways

That opponent scoring has been aided by the fastest pace for any team in the 29 seasons of play-by-play data. Of course, the pace doesn’t seem to be aiding the Bulls … unless they’re big fans of the 2025 Draft class. They’ve played in three of the eight fastest-paced games of the season and lost those three games (including the two over the weekend) by an average of 24.3 points (21.7 per 100 possessions).


Prior to getting clobbered by the Rockets on Sunday, the Bulls’ previous five games were all within five points in the last five minutes, and they’ve been closing with Ayo Dosunmu on the floor instead of either Josh Giddey or Patrick Williams. Dosunmu hit a pair of big free throws down the stretch in New York, but overall, the Chicago offense has struggled (104.6 points scored per 100 possessions) with him on the floor. The fourth-year guard has shot just 26% from 3-point range, including 4-for-29 (14%) on above-the-break 3s.


The point differential in those fast-paced games has been even bigger (minus-28.7 per game) in the paint. The Bulls have been outscored in the paint in 12 of their 14 games, including each of the last nine.

This is a light week of games league-wide, but the Bulls’ loss to the Rockets on Sunday was the start of their only stretch of five games in seven days. Their game in Detroit on Monday will be the second game of a back-to-back for both teams.

The Bucks won two straight games, but their first winning streak came to an end with a bad call in Charlotte on Saturday afternoon.
Three takeaways

The Bucks lost to the Hornets because of a bad call, but also because they were outscored by 26 points on fast breaks (22-9) and second chances (21-8). And they still had a chance to win after the phantom foul on Giannis Antetokounmpo, but he missed a mid-range jumper (with Grant Williams giving him plenty of space to shoot) for the win.


Antetokounmpo’s 26-for-56 (46.4%) from mid-range is still the best mark of his career by a wide margin. He was 7-for-11 from mid-range and 16-for-17 from the line as he totaled 59 points (second-highest total of his career) in the Bucks’ overtime win over the Pistons on Wednesday, draining two jumpers (one mid-range, one 3-pointer) on the Bucks’ 8-0 run to start the extra period.


The last three games have come without Damian Lillard (concussion protocol) and without a real solution at point guard. Delon Wright was supposed to be that guy, but has shot just 30% (including 4-for-20 from 3-point range) this season. The Bucks scored just 101.8 points per 100 possessions with Wright on the floor (vs. 117.6 with him off the floor) over the three games.

After their one-game trip to Charlotte, the Bucks are back in Milwaukee for a four-game homestand in which they’ll have an opportunity to avenge a playoff-series loss to the Pacers, as well as early-season losses to both the Bulls and Hornets.

Joel Embiid is back in uniform, but not nearly back to form, and the Sixers have yet to start digging themselves out of this hole.
Three takeaways

The good news is that the Sixers might have a big four once everybody is healthy because Jared McCain is a player. The rookie has averaged 28.3 points on a true shooting percentage of 66.9% over the last four games. He’s been hunting shots, but also making some good decisions with the ball, picking up 10 assists in the loss (without Embiid and Paul George) to Cleveland on Wednesday. The Cavs went to a box-and-one defense out of a fourth-quarter timeout because McCain was doing so much damage (and perhaps as a tribute to Nick Nurse).


The bad news is that Embiid, even though he was technically able to play several days before he actually played, was not very good in his 59 minutes over two games. The former MVP was 10-for-10 from the line in Orlando on Friday but has shot just 3-for-20 from outside the paint (with just six field goal attempts in the paint).


The Sixers scored less than a point per possession in both of the games Embiid played in, including less than 90 per 100 over his 59 minutes on the floor.

The Sixers don’t have any back-to-backs in the next couple of weeks, and they’ll have rest advantages in four of their next six games, including visits to Miami and Memphis on Monday and Wednesday.

The Pelicans remain depleted by injuries, but they showed some resilience over the weekend, beating the Jokić-less Nuggets and going down to the wire with the Lakers.
Three takeaways

The Pels did get Trey Murphy III back last week, though he shot just 6-for-22 from 3-point range over his first three games. They still don’t have a lineup that’s played more than 31 minutes and two of the four guys who’ve played at least 200 minutes with Brandon Ingram are Javonte Green (signed to a minimum contract in late August) and Brandon Boston Jr. (claimed off waivers the day before the season started). Both of those guys hit big 3-pointers down the stretch against Denver on Friday.


Ingram, unsurprisingly, is registering the highest usage rate of his career (31.5%). But he’s actually been assisted on more than half of his field goals (53.4%) for the first time. The teammate who’s assisted him most (18 times) is Boston, who’s averaged 5.0 assists per 36 minutes, up from 2.2 per 36 through his first three seasons.


The Pels have seen a bigger drop-off from last season on defense than they have on offense, but they held Denver to just a point per possession on Friday. They lead the league in opponent free throw rate (20.1 attempts per 100 shots from the field), and Denver had just 11 attempts at the line.

The Pels scored just 102.6 points per 100 possessions as they lost their first two games against the Warriors by double-digits. Their third meeting is Friday, one of just two home games on a stretch where they’re playing six of eight on the road.

Still playing very shorthanded, the Raptors have lost seven straight games and are one of two 0-2 teams – the Sixers are the other – in the NBA Cup. But they’ve had a lot of narrow losses against good teams.
Three takeaways

The Raptors rank 28th defensively, but are the only team with multiple losses when allowing a point per possession or less. They lost ugly ones to the Bucks and Pistons last week, shooting a brutal 43-for-111 (38.7%) in the paint over the two games.


They were better in the paint (38-for-67, 57%) on Saturday when they took the Celtics to overtime but couldn’t get the bucket they needed down the stretch. The Raptors are now 1-6 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes. RJ Barrett’s 8-for-26 on clutch field goals is the second-worst mark among 16 players with at least 15 attempts, and his 9-for-16 on clutch free throws is the second-worst mark among 13 players with at least 10 attempts.


Jakob Pöltl has totaled 60 points and 30 rebounds over the last two games, with his 35 points (on 16-for-19 shooting) against the Celtics on Saturday being his career high. Over the seven-game losing streak, the Raptors have been outscored by only 0.8 points per 100 possessions in 188 minutes with Pöltl and Gradey Dick on the floor, but bench minutes have been rough.

The Raptors are one of seven teams with no NBA Cup games this week. They’ll have a rest advantage when they host the Pacers on Monday.

The Jazz got a good win over the Mavs (their first home win of the season) last week, but remain in last place in the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

After coming off the bench in the first nine games, John Collins has started the last four, averaging a team-high 21.5 points over that stretch and getting the game-winning dunk against Dallas on Thursday. The Jazz have outscored their opponents by 1.1 points per 100 possessions in 147 minutes with Collins and Lauri Markkanen on the floor together.


Rookie Isaiah Collier is also starting to get some playing time, which may be a necessary thing for the backcourt. The Jazz have been outscored by 18.2 points per 100 possessions (having allowed 123.9 per 100) in 388 total minutes with at least two of Keyonte George, Collin Sexton and Jordan Clarkson on the floor, but are just minus-3.0 per 100 (having allowed 111.3 per 100) in 206 total minutes with only one of the three on the floor.


The Jazz have committed more turnovers than their opponent in 12 of their 13 games, with the differential of 10 (19-9) against the Clippers on Sunday being their third double-digit differential of the season. Their season-long differential of 5.3 per game would be the worst mark for any team in the 48 seasons for which turnovers have been counted.

The Jazz have already split two games against the Spurs, and they’ll meet two more times in the next nine days. They’ll finish their four-game trip in San Antonio on Thursday and then begin a five-game homestand (where Game 2 is against the Spurs) two nights later.

The Wizards’ eight-game losing streak includes a loss (on Friday) to the one team (the Hawks) they’ve beat this season.
Three takeaways

The loss in Atlanta on Friday did come with the best game of Alex Sarr’s young career. The rookie had 20 points (shooting 3-for-4 from 3-point range), seven rebounds, four steals and three blocks in 31 minutes. His overall rim protection numbers aren’t great (teams have shot 61% at the rim when he’s been there), but Sarr’s 3.2 blocks per 36 minutes rank sixth among 309 players who’ve played at least 100 minutes.


Malcolm Brogdon made his season debut on Sunday and, while he shot 0-for-4 in 22 minutes off the bench, you have to wonder when the Wizards might put him in the starting lineup. The current group (with Kyle Kuzma back) has been outscored by an amazing 35.2 points per 100 possessions in its 75 minutes, and the Wizards have scored just 94.1 per 100 in 199 total minutes with Jordan Poole and Bub Carrington in the backcourt together.


The Wizards’ point differential of minus-13.7 points per game is the worst mark for any team through 12 games in the last nine seasons since the 0-12, 2015-16 Sixers had a differential of minus-14.0 per game.

Those numbers could get worse with the Wizards playing the Knicks and Celtics this week. They trailed Boston by 32 points (losing by 20) in their first game of the season.

It's become abundantly clear that this Utah Jazz campaign is going to be all about where they end up in the 2025 draft lottery.
And that makes sense. There's a lot of young talent there from the last two drafts. And Lauri Markkanen has proved good enough to be one of the most important players on a title contender.
But it still feels like this roster is missing a true franchise cornerstone-level talent to play alongside Markkanen. Cooper Flagg, Ace Bailey, Dylan Harper or Egor Demin could be such a player, but the Jazz will likely have to land a top-five pick to secure one of those talents.
That means any nick, sprain, swelling or whatever else pops up on the veterans should be milked as much as possible. Utah is actually winning the minutes it plays both Markkanen and John Collins.
And at this point, winning any stretch probably isn't great for the team's long-term prospects."

And now that some of those players are starting to filter back into the rotation, Brandon Ingram has suddenly missed three of New Orleans' last four.
If this persists, the losses keep piling up and the Pelicans have another sub-.500 month in December, they might have to consider leaning into the losing.

It doesn't look like there's an end in sight for the Philadelphia 76ers' woes.
Joel Embiid and Paul George are both out with knee injuries. Philly is somehow 0-4 in the few games Embiid has managed to play.
And when asked about what can be expected of Embiid for the rest of the season, head coach Nick Nurse said the organization really doesn't know:
After Joel Embiid experienced knee swelling (I misspoke and said soreness, but it's swelling) after four games in nine days, head coach Nick Nurse was asked what can be expected from Joel the rest of the season. #Sixers @KYWNewsradio pic.twitter.com/p1Sm4rwYXl
If every appearance leads to swelling in his knee, the Sixers might have to think long and hard about just shutting him down and taking things reeeal slow with PG.
The approach would lead to a lot more losing, but it would also give Tyrese Maxey and Jared McCain experience and opportunities to lead a team.

The Toronto Raptors' record is bad. No doubt about that. But they've gotten just three appearances out of starting guard Immanuel Quickley.
And even after Wednesday's blowout win over the reeling New Orleans Pelicans, RJ Barrett and Scottie Barnes have only appeared in five games and played 119 minutes together.
Wednesday, that duo looked great, combining for 39 points, 20 rebounds and 18 assists. Barrett was plus-23, while Barnes was plus-33.
Granted, that came against one of the most injury-ravaged teams in the league, but it was an encouraging result. And once (or if) Quickley joins the two forwards, wins should be easier to come by.
Toronto might actually want to stay in the potentially star-studded lottery, but being in the East also means the Raptors are well within striking distance of a play-in spot."

LaMelo Ball is starting to play a bit like he did in the high school YouTube videos that helped make him famous.
In Wednesday's loss to the Miami Heat, Ball had 32 points, but it took him 35 shots to get there. That's the second most field-goal attempts by a Charlotte Hornets player in a single game in franchise history. And the record? Well, that's the 38 shots he got up against the Milwaukee Bucks earlier this season.
On the season, Ball's 24.9 field-goal attempts per game leads the entire NBA. And while he has a positive net rating swing (meaning Charlotte's point differential per 100 possessions is better when he plays) and a way-above-average box plus/minus, it's easy to wonder if the Hornets would be closer to .500 if he leaned a little harder into distribution.
Moving the ball around and getting plenty of shots for everyone fosters team-wide confidence more than watching the star dance up top for half a possession before launching a contested jumper."

On the bright side, being in the East means Detroit is still tied for 10th place. And the absence of Cunningham has given Jaden Ivey a chance to spread his wings a bit.

In Wednesday's win, Trae Young had 22 assists, while three of the largely interchangeable forwards (Zaccharie Risacher, Jalen Johnson and De'Andre Hunter) each had at least 17 points.

The Minnesota Timberwolves are in a bit of a tailspin, having lost four straight and seven of their last nine.
And though it's still pretty early, it might already be time to start looking for deals for Julius Randle.
I have learned to never advocate for panic trades because teams figure stuff out and just need time and teams really only move from positions of opportunity rather than urgency. All that to say the Wolves need to trade Julius Randle NOW.
All the fears that accompanied him to Minnesota as part of the Karl-Anthony Towns trade are proving valid. His ball-dominance mucks up the offense and takes possessions away from Anthony Edwards. Opposing defenses not worrying about his shooting makes the floor cramped on offense. And though KAT was no lockdown defender himself, he worked far better in the defensive scheme alongside Rudy Gobert than Randle has.
Through 18 games, Minnesota is plus-0.3 points per 100 possessions with Randle on the floor and plus-3.7 when he's off. And it's not as if this is some outlier month-long stretch. Over the course of his career, his teams have been better with him off the floor"

But that's not all. Sacramento also signed veteran wing Jae Crowder, who started his first game for the team in Wednesday's road win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.

That may have something to do with Nikola Jokić missing three games and Aaron Gordon being out since early November, but the biggest culprit is likely Jamal Murray.
During the 2023 playoff run that ended with a championship, he looked like the modern-day Kobe Bryant. This season, he's shooting 41.5 percent from the field and 32.6 percent from three, while getting blown by and missing rotations on defense.

It's been an up-and-down season for the New York Knicks, and this week was sort of a microcosm of that.
On Monday, they smashed Nikola Jokić's Denver Nuggets (in Denver) and scored 145 points. But the week was bookended with losses to the rebuilding Utah Jazz and a Dallas Mavericks squad without Luka Dončić.
And if you're looking for a reason for the inconsistency, you don't have to go much further than the defense. New York is scoring a whopping 122.1 points per 100 possessions (a mark that trails only the Cleveland Cavaliers), but it's surrendering 116.6 (a mark that ranks 24th).
This certainly isn't characteristic of a Tom Thibodeau-coached team and should maybe even be encouraging for Knicks fans.
Even with the bad defense, New York is above .500 and has a top-10 net rating. Thibodeau is likely to get this team working better on the less glamorous end of the floor (with the help of solid wing defenders such as OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges).

Things felt pretty bleak after the Orlando Magic lost their first four games without Paolo Banchero, who's been out with an oblique injury since November 1.
However, after a blowout victory over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, Orlando has now won 10 of its last 11 games. And during that stretch, their two leading scorers are the Brothers Wagner.
Franz is at 27.0 points, 6.9 assists, 5.5 rebounds and 2.3 steals, while Moritz is adding 14.7 points and 4.7 rebounds in just 20.2 minutes.
With the confidence those two are gaining in larger roles, the Magic could be a near lock to finish in the top four after Banchero comes back."

The Houston Rockets have undoubtedly taken a big step forward, and that applies to just about everyone on the roster.
Prior to Wednesday's win over the Philadelphia 76ers, though, one starter seemed to be lagging behind.
Through his first 19 games, Jalen Green was shooting 38.1 percent from the field and 30.3 percent from deep. And more importantly, the team's net rating was dramatically better when he was off the floor.
His shoot-first, defense-last game make him, at best, a tricky fit for Houston's otherwise egalitarian offense and rigid defense.
But on Wednesday, Green dropped 41 points on 12-of-20 shooting. He drew 14 free-throw attempts. It was a reminder of the offensive upside he can bring. And though he's obviously not going to drop 40-plus every night, defenses knowing he's capable will make life easier for every other Rocket on the floor."

Stephen Curry missed the Golden State Warriors' last game of the week with ""patellofemoral pain"" in his knee, but their little slide toward the middle of the West began earlier.
Following their loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, the Warriors have now dropped three straight and four of their last six. And it's starting to feel like they might need more from the young core (especially now De'Anthony Melton is out for the season with an ACL tear).
On the year, Jonathan Kuminga is shooting 30.5 percent from deep. Brandin Podziemski has been even worse, making only 19.7 percent of his threes. And despite starting all but the team's most recent game, Trayce Jackson-Davis has a negative net rating swing.
Golden State has still been better than most could have expected at this point in the season, but realistic contention for Curry's fifth title may require another developmental step from one or two of the above."

Still, there isn't much to nitpick here. Kenny Atkinson's rotation makes more sense than last season's. The ball-handling balance between Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland has been fine, and the offense hasn't felt too cramped when Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen are both on the floor.
On the season, Mitchell is averaging 24.7 points and 3.9 assists. Garland is at 20.2 points and 6.9 assists. Mobley is adding 17.8 points, 9.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.1 steals. And Allen is at 14.9 points, 11.0 rebounds and 1.1 blocks."

Over his three appearances, he's averaging 15.3 points, 12.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 2.0 blocks.
He would've helped even if Holmgren hadn't gone down, but Hartenstein's rim protection, rebounding and underrated passing feel even more important now. And they've allowed the Thunder to keep rolling through opponents without, arguably, their second-best player."

OffRtg: 120.5 (3) DefRtg: 111.1 (10) NetRtg: +9.5 (3) Pace: 97.7 (25)
The Celtics won the first meeting of the two best teams in the Eastern Conference and handed the Cavs their first loss. They also picked up another quality win by holding off the Wolves on Sunday afternoon.
Three takeaways

The Celtics had second-half leads of 21 and 19 points against the Cavs and Wolves, only for both games to go down to the wire. Over their eight home games, they’ve allowed 108.5 points per 100 possessions before halftime and 125.6 per 100 in the second half.


The Celtics, of course, dominated both opponents from beyond the arc, even outscoring Washington from 3-point range on Friday when they shot just 11-for-46 (24%) from deep. Their record differential from 3-point range (plus-20.3 points per game) is as much about defense as it is offense, with the Celtics one of two teams — the Rockets are the other — that rank in the top five in both opponent 3-point percentage (34.3%, fourth) and the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come from 3-point range (38.7%, lowest).


With those big leads (almost) disappearing, eight of the Celtics’ last nine games have been within five points in the last five minutes. Jaylen Brown and Derrick White are a combined 10-for-17 on clutch 3-pointers after they each hit big ones on Sunday, while Jayson Tatum (just 4-for-16 on clutch 3-pointers) ranks second in total clutch points (44).

The Celtics have still played just three games (the fewest in the league) against the 14 teams that currently have winning records, though they’re responsible for the Wolves (9-8 prior to Sunday) losing their spot in that group. They’ll face the 11-7 Clippers and 17-1 Cavs this week, with those also being just their third and fourth games against teams that currently rank in the top 10 defensively.

Not too surprisingly, the Cavs’ winning streak ended in Boston on Tuesday. They were somewhat shorthanded, but they showed some fight in cutting a 21-point deficit down to two in the second half.
Three takeaways

While the Cavs’ 3-point shooting (league-best 41.5%) is probably unsustainable, the same could probably be said about how well their opponents have shot (37.8%, second-highest mark) from beyond the arc. According to Second Spectrum tracking, Cleveland ranks fifth regarding opponent shot quality, but their opponents have exceeded expectations in how well they’ve shot in 12 of their 18 games, with the Boston loss (when the Celtics shot 22-for-41 from 3-point range) being the biggest such differential.


With Darius Garland out against New Orleans on Wednesday, Ty Jerome started and scored a career-high 29 points. Garland was back in the lineup over the weekend, but Jerome still scored another 26 points in 28 minutes off the bench against Toronto. Jerome now has an incredibly effective field goal percentage of 84% on pull-up jumpers, having shot 14-for-19 (74%) on pull-up 2-pointers and 17-for-28 (61%) on pull-up 3-pointers.


The Cavs didn’t get their first multi-day break of the season until after the Boston loss and their win over the Pelicans the following night. Their win over the Raptors on Sunday was their only game in six days, a good thing considering that they’ve been missing key pieces in their rotation. (Caris LeVert, Isaac Okoro and Dean Wade all missed the Boston game.) Max Strus still hasn’t played all season, but his original injury timeline had him scheduled to be re-evaluated this week.

The Cavs will get another shot at the Celtics on Sunday, and this time they’ll be at home, where they’ve outscored their opponents by an amazing 40.5 points per 100 possessions in the first quarter and led all 10 of their games by at least 15 points.

The Warriors remain at the top of the Western Conference, though they doubled their loss total last week.
Three takeaways

The Warriors were 12-0 when leading by double digits and 12-0 when leading after the third quarter before Saturday. Then they blew a 17-point lead in San Antonio by scoring just 13 points over the final 13 1/2 minutes (27 offensive possessions), with 11 players contributing to the collapse.


That wasn’t the only ugly offense last week. Two of the Warriors’ four losses have come to the Clippers, with those being their two worst offensive games of the season (98.1 points scored per 100 possessions total). Over their first nine games (including three he missed), they scored 115.6 points per 100 possessions with Stephen Curry off the floor. Over their last seven, they’ve scored just 87.1 per 100 when he’s been on the bench.


That’s not really about the absence of De’Anthony Melton (they scored just 90.1 per 100 in 74 minutes with Melton on the floor without Curry), but the 26-year-old will miss the rest of the season with an ACL injury … and will be missed. He was asked to defend some of the league’s best guards, and the Warriors had allowed less than a point per possession in his 121 minutes over six games.

The Warriors are the only team to have clinched a spot in the Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals and won’t have any Cup games this week. Instead, they’ll have two regular Western Conference tests, hosting the Thunder on Wednesday and visiting the Suns three nights later. Melton scored a season-high 19 points when they won in Oklahoma City earlier this month.

The Thunder had some success with small ball, but after losing two straight games, were happy to have Isaiah Hartenstein make his season debut on Wednesday.
Three takeaways

The Thunder have outscored their opponents by almost 12 points per 100 possessions in 162 minutes with Jalen Williams at the five, and Williams ranks as one of the league’s best rim protectors, with opponents having shot just 48.4% at the rim when he’s been there.


But the Thunder were outscored by 26 points on second chances as they lost consecutive games to the Mavs and Spurs. Oklahoma City ranks 29th in defensive rebounding percentage (66.4%) and last in second chance points allowed, both per game (17.3) and per 100 possessions (17.1). That last number would be the highest opponent mark for any team in the last 20 seasons.


They allowed 10 second-chance points in Hartenstein’s 29 minutes off the bench on Wednesday but still outscored the Blazers by 14 points overall with the big man on the floor. And he was on the floor down the stretch, picking up a big block on Shaedon Sharpe as the Thunder finally took control with a 10-1 run. With the win, they’re 4-0 in the second game of back-to-backs.

Having had four days off, the Thunder will now embark on a pretty tough, four-game trip. Depending on the Emirates Cup schedule, they’ll play 10, 11 or 12 of their next 14 games on the road.

The Rockets suffered a couple of tough, late-game losses last week and their loss Saturday to the Blazers ended their seven-game home winning streak.
Three takeaways

The Pacers shot more effectively than the Rockets on Wednesday, but Houston won by 17, because (thanks to turnovers and offensive rebounds) it had 23 more shooting opportunities, tied for the biggest differential in any game this season. The Rockets’ season-long average (7.7 more shooting opportunities per game than their opponents) would be the second biggest differential in the last 52 years. Fred VanVleet was also on the only team (the 2022-23 Raptors) with a better mark (+9.1 per game).


With their two losses last week, the Rockets are 1-3 in the second games of back-to-backs (with the only win coming against the Wizards) and 11-3 otherwise. They’ve scored just 104.1 points per 100 possessions over those four games without rest, with four of their five starters (all except Alperen Sengun) having shot below 40%. Their Saturday loss to the Blazers (who they played the night before, to be fair) was their worst offensive performance of the season (98 points on 99 possessions).


The loss to Portland was the second time the Rockets have been outscored on fast break points. They had almost doubled up their opponents (172-87) on the break over their previous seven games.

The next two weeks should be one of the Rockets’ toughest stretches of the season. Five of the six games are on the road, with the one home game (Sunday) coming against the Thunder. The previous meeting (in Oklahoma City earlier this month) was the Rockets’ only double-digit loss of the season and the only other time they’ve been outscored on the break.

Luka Dončić has missed three of the last four games with knee and wrist injuries, but the Mavs have won in Oklahoma City and Denver without him. They came one stop short of winning in Miami on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The two wins without Dončić have been two of the Mavs’ five best offensive games of the season. P.J. Washington led them with 27 points in Oklahoma City and had seven on the 9-0 run that turned a five-point deficit into a four-point lead with less than a minute left in Denver on Friday.


The leading scorer against the Nuggets was Naji Marshall, who has somehow seized a portion of the Dallas offense from Dončić and Kyrie Irving. The Mavs’ two stars have both seen drops in the percentage of their minutes that they have the ball from last season, with Marshall averaging a career-high 2.0 minutes of possession.


With both of the weekend games going down the wire, Marshall was on the floor instead of Klay Thompson for most of the clutch minutes. Thompson didn’t take a shot in the 4.3 clutch minutes he played, while the Mavs shot 1-for-16 on clutch 3-pointers, including 1-for-13 in the overtime loss in Miami. They’re now 3-7 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes and 6-1 otherwise.

The Mavs have already had three rest-disadvantage games, and they’ll have two more this week. The first (Monday) is in Atlanta, and the second (Sunday) is more than 2,000 miles away in Portland.

The Nuggets got a win without Nikola Jokić, and then got the Kia VP back in time to dominate the Lakers once again.
Three takeaways

The Jokić-less win over Memphis came with the 200th career (regular-season) triple-double for Russell Westbrook, who also made a big contribution (14 points, four assists, 6-for-7 shooting) in their huge second half in L.A. on Saturday. That was just the second game in which the Nuggets outscored their opponents with Westbrook on the floor.


They beat the Grizzlies without him, but the Nuggets were outscored by 21 points in 20 minutes with Jokić off the floor over the weekend, with their three-point loss to the Mavs on Friday being their third defeat in which he recorded a positive plus-minus. His on-off differential for the season (30.5 points per 100 possessions) remains absurd.


Jamal Murray might be getting his legs back under him. He shot just 16-for-53 (30%) from 3-point range over the Nuggets’ first 12 games, but is 11-for-25 (44%) over the last three, with his five 3s in the Memphis win being a season high. He continues to struggle inside the arc, though. Murray (43.5%) and Westbrook (38.5%) rank 128th and 133rd in 2-point percentage among 133 players with at least 75 2-point attempts.

Their win in L.A. this past weekend was the Nuggets’ third rest-disadvantage game of the season. After Monday, they’ll be one of two teams that haven’t played with a rest advantage, with their first advantage game coming Wednesday in Utah. Their first game against the Jazz (at home earlier this month) was both their biggest win and best defensive game (statistically) of the season.

The Clippers remain more than competitive, and they’ve won five straight games to climb into the top five in the West.
Three takeaways

They continue to get it done with defense, allowing just 98.4 points per 100 possessions over the winning streak. Some of that, of course, is bad 3-point shooting, with the opponents having shot just 26.9% from beyond the arc over the five games. For the season, LA has the league’s fourth-highest opponent 3-point rate (44% of shots coming from 3-point range), but ranks second in opponent 3-point percentage (33.4%).


James Harden is registering the lowest marks of his career in both 2-point percentage (41.7%) and 3-point percentage (31.7%), but his free throw rate (47.7 attempts per 100 shots from the field) ranks third among 68 players with at least 200 field goal attempts and is his highest rate in the last three seasons. He’s 39-for-41 (95%) from the line over the winning streak.


The Clippers are the only team with multiple wins over one of the top five teams in the league, having handed the Warriors two of their four losses. The Clips were at a rest disadvantage last Monday when they held Golden State under a point per possession, though they certainly benefitted from the Warriors shooting 9-for-19 from the free throw line in the three-point win.

The Clippers’ win in Philadelphia on Sunday came with their largest margin of victory (26 points) this season and was the start of a four-game trip. Both teams will be playing the second game of a back-to-back in Boston on Monday night.

The Magic have won eight of their last nine games, a stretch highlighted by Franz Wagner’s game-winning 3-pointer in L.A. on Thursday.
Three takeaways

Wagner has averaged 28.3 points, 6.3 rebounds and 7.0 assists (with just 1.8 turnovers) over the 8-1 stretch. He’s had the ball in his hands for 5.5 minutes per game over Paolo Banchero’s 13-game absence, up from just 2.5 minutes per game over the Magic’s first five games.


The Magic’s current starting lineup — with Tristan da Silva and Goga Bitadze in place of Banchero and Wendell Carter Jr. — has been outscored by 1.2 points per 100 possessions in its 145 minutes. But bench minutes (though they weren’t great on Thursday) have generally been terrific, with the Magic outscoring their opponents by 13.9 per 100 (allowing just 91.9 per 100) in 119 minutes with Wagner on the bench over the 8-1 stretch.


Mo Wagner has been a big part of that bench’s success and is the Magic’s second-leading scorer (14.6 points per game) in the last nine games. He’s one of eight players who’ve played at least 200 minutes this season and averaged at least 24 points and eight rebounds per 36, with the other seven being Victor Wembanyama and six guys with at least four All-Star appearances.

Jalen Suggs missed the second half of the Magic’s win over the Pistons with a hamstring issue but isn’t on the injury report for their game in Charlotte on Monday. Carter Jr. is listed as questionable to make his return from an 11-game absence. Orlando is 2-0 in the NBA Cup with East Group A games remaining in Brooklyn (Friday) and New York.

Ja Morant has now missed the last eight games, but the Grizzlies have won five of the eight to remain in the top seven in the West.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies have scored more efficiently in their nine games without Morant (116.0 points scored per 100 possessions) than they have in the eight games he’s played (115.4 per 100). Scotty Pippen Jr. had a career-high 30 points and 10 assists in their win in Chicago on Saturday, with 16 of the 30 coming (on 8-for-8 shooting) in the paint. Morant (13.9) and Pippen (9.0) rank second and ninth in points in the paint per 36 minutes among 56 players under 6-4 who’ve played at least 100 minutes.


But over these last eight games without Morant, the Grizzlies have scored much more efficiently with Pippen off the floor (121.7 points per 100 possessions) than they have with him on the floor (106.8 per 100). For the season, they have the league’s fifth-ranked bench.


There were only three possessions of clutch time in the Grizzlies’ win over the Sixers on Wednesday (when Philly cut a 19-point, fourth-quarter lead down to four), but that ended their five-game losing streak in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, while also taking them to 3-0 in the second games of back-to-backs.

They don’t have any back-to-backs this week, but they do have a four-game homestand with all four opponents at least three games below .500. The Grizzlies already have a 45-point win over the Blazers, who will be in Memphis on Monday, with Morant listed as questionable to make his return.

The Knicks won four straight games to give the Eastern Conference a fourth team with a winning record, but they stumbled in Utah on Saturday afternoon.
Three takeaways

The Knicks continue to be carried by the league’s second-ranked offense, scoring an amazing 131.8 points per 100 possessions over the winning streak, which included two of the nine most efficient performances for any team this season. They shot 50% from the field, 40% from 3-point range and 90% from the line in both of their wins early last week.


Their five starters all made more than half of their shots over the four games. Josh Hart has an effective field goal percentage of 66.3% this season, the fifth-best mark among 190 players with at least 100 field goal attempts and up from just 49.3% last season. His 61-for-83 (73%) shooting in the paint is tied with Victor Wembanyama for the best mark among 109 players who’ve taken at least 75 shots in the paint.


The offense cooled off on Saturday when the Knicks allowed the Jazz to shoot 19-for-34 (56%) from 3-point range. New York is now one of three teams that rank in the bottom six in both opponent 3-point percentage (37.5%, 25th) and the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come from 3-point range (45.6%, second highest).

Having split the first two games of their five-game trip, the Knicks are 1-2 against the Western Conference, with all three games having come on the road. The trip continues through Denver and Dallas, with the Knicks 0-4 against the Mavs since Jalen Brunson left Dallas for New York (0-2 with Brunson in uniform, 0-2 without him).

Three takeaways

The two losses came with the Lakers allowing Orlando and Denver to score more than 124 points per 100 possessions. Though four of their last five games have come against teams that currently rank in the bottom 10 offensively, the Lakers still rank in the bottom five on defense. They rank 28th in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (60.1%) and 26th in defensive rebounding percentage (68.0%).


The Lakers continue to rank near the top of the league (second) in free throw differential, but they lost to Orlando because they shot 2-for-8 from the line in the final four minutes, with Anthony Davis missing two free throws with less than 20 seconds left and L.A. up two. They lead the league in clutch 3-point percentage (10-for-19, 53%), but are 29th in clutch free throw percentage (16-for-27, 59%).


Rui Hachimura returned from a four-game absence on Saturday and was back in the starting lineup. Rookie Dalton Knecht had a huge game (37 points, 9-for-12 from 3-point range) in Hachimura’s absence on Tuesday, but since D’Angelo Russell was moved to the bench eight games ago, the Lakers’ two starting lineups (with Hachimura or Knecht at the four) have been outscored by 14.3 points per 100 possessions in 94 total minutes.

The Lakers remain undefeated (9-0) in NBA Cup play all-time, but have a pair of tough Cup games this week. Their visit to Phoenix on Tuesday is also the start of their first stretch of five games in seven days.

Three takeaways

The first two wins came without Victor Wembanyama as the Spurs held the Thunder and Jazz to just 106.7 points per 100 possessions. This winning streak has also come with Harrison Barnes’ three highest-scoring games of the season, and Barnes had a pair of big buckets down the stretch against the Warriors on Saturday, helping the Spurs complete a crazy comeback against his former team.


The Spurs have trailed each of their last four games by double-digits, but now have four wins (they’re 4-7) after trailing by 10 points or more. Last season, they won only two of the first 33 games that they trailed by 10 or more (finishing 8-53). They were down 17 late in the third quarter on Saturday before outscoring the Warriors, 40-13, over the final 13 minutes.


The Spurs’ total point differential over their last four games is just plus-7. But they’re a plus-38 (89-51) at the free throw line over that stretch, with their opponents attempting just 16.5 free throws per 100 shots from the field. With that, they’re a hair ahead of the Celtics for the lowest opponent free throw rate (20.4 per 100) for the season.

The top two teams in free throw rate (on offense) are the Lakers and Jazz, who the Spurs will face this week. Two of the three times they’ve been outscored at the line are losses to Utah (by one point, minus-8 at the line) and L.A. (by five points, minus-6 at the line) in the last 16 days.

A two-point loss in Boston on Sunday isn’t one to worry too much about. But it dropped the Wolves back to .500 because they had a more troublesome loss (the franchise’s 20th straight defeat in Toronto) three nights earlier.
Three takeaways

The Wolves have seen the league’s second biggest jump in points allowed per 100 possessions from last season (only the Pelicans have seen a bigger drop-off defensively), but the bigger difference between their wins (121.0 points scored per 100 possessions) and losses (107.1) has been on offense. With the two losses this week, they’re 2-7 when Anthony Edwards has had an effective field goal percentage below 60%.


The Wolves scored just five points on seven clutch possessions on Sunday, but that wasn’t as bad as their clutch performance (zero points on eight possessions) in Toronto. That was the only time this season that a team has gone scoreless on more than three clutch possessions, with the Wolves also one of two teams that went scoreless on at least eight clutch possessions in a game last season. They were 2-for-2 over the two games on clutch 2-pointers but had four turnovers and were 0-for-5 on clutch 3s, with that not including Naz Reid’s attempt that came a split second after the buzzer on Sunday.


With the two losses, the Wolves are 0-3 (the other loss came in Portland) without Mike Conley, who’s dealing with a toe sprain. Nickeil Alexander-Walker got the start in his hometown (Donte DiVincenzo started in Boston) and shot 2-for-13 over the two games, though the Wolves have still been at their best (plus-9.1 points per 100 possessions) with him on the floor.

The Wolves are in fourth place in West Group A, but can still win their group with wins over the Rockets and Clippers this week. Even without the NBA Cup designation, those are two big games in the Western Conference.

Three takeaways

Damian Lillard returned from a three-game absence last week and had the game-winning bucket against the Rockets on Monday, but Giannis Antetokounmpo remains the Bucks’ dominant force. Two days before recording a 37-point triple-double against the Pacers, he outscored the Bulls in the restricted area (28-24) by himself. His 18.8 points per game in the restricted area would be the most for any player in the 29 seasons for which we have shot-location data, topping his record of 18.1 per game last season.


The bigger difference between the Bucks’ 2-8 start (115.7 points allowed per 100 possessions) and their last seven games (108.1 allowed per 100) has been on defense, though they’ve only climbed from 22nd to 17th. None of the seven opponents rank higher than 15th offensively.


It’s also been a home-heavy stretch, and the Bucks’ only road win remains their opening-night victory in Philadelphia. They’re one of two teams – the Magic are the other – that have been at least seven points per 100 possessions better, both offensively and defensively, at home than they’ve been on the road.

Not including their two unscheduled games for Week 8, the Bucks are playing eight of their next 12 on the road. They can end their six-game road losing streak and improve to 3-0 in the NBA Cup with a win in Miami (where Antetokounmpo is 9-13 all-time) on Tuesday.

They’ve trailed four of the five games by 19 points or more.


Tyus Jones has 40 assists and just three turnovers over the five games, taking his season-long assist/turnover ratio to 6.47. That would be the fourth-highest mark in NBA history (Jones holds the other three top spots).


The Suns have still been outscored by 12.4 points per 100 possessions in 136 minutes with Jones and Devin Booker on the floor together over the losing streak. They rank 28th defensively over the streak, with their opponents having shot 61% from 2-point range and 41% from beyond the arc.

After a 2-4 road trip, the Heat got Jimmy Butler back and got two wins at home to climb back to .500.
Three takeaways

With Terry Rozier out, Butler started at point guard the last two games. He totaled 11 assists in the two wins, but his scoring efficiency (63 points on 19-for-29 from the field and 24-for-29 from the line) was the big boon. The Heat scored just 54 points on 65 offensive possessions (83 per 100) in his 29 minutes off the floor over the two games.


Butler somehow did not get a foul call on his game-tying dunk at the end of regulation against Dallas on Sunday, the second time in 15 days the Heat used a back-screen action to tie the game in the closing seconds. He still has a free throw rate of 71.4 attempts per 100 shots from the field, which would be the highest rate for somebody his size (or shorter) in the last 18 seasons (since Corey Maggette in 2006-07).


The Heat are back to within just a hair of ranking in the top 10 defensively again. But they benefitted from facing the struggling Sixers (without Tyrese Maxey) and shorthanded Mavs (no Luka Dončić) last week, and they haven’t been very good defensively (122 points allowed per 100 possessions) in 168 minutes with Butler, Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro on the floor together.

The Heat had five days off before their win over the Mavs on Sunday, but the end of their three-game homestand (Tuesday vs. the streaking Bucks) is the start of their first stretch of five games in seven days.

De’Aaron Fox totaled 60 points over the two games and the starters outscored the Clippers and Nets by 15 points in their 37 minutes on the floor together. But the Kings (still missing Malik Monk) were outscored by 36 points (scoring just 90 per 100 possessions) in 57 minutes with at least one reserve on the floor over the two losses.


The Kings are 8-9 with their four most-used lineups having outscored their opponents by 18.6 points per 100 possessions in 263 total minutes.


That doesn’t mean that the starters have been great. The losing streak has been just the third, fourth and fifth times that the Kings have scored less than 110 points per 100 possessions, with three of the starters — DeRozan, Kevin Huerter and Keegan Murray — having combined to shoot just 6-for-39 (15%) from 3-point range over the three games. Huerter and Murray have gone from a combined 40.7% from beyond the arc two seasons ago to 35.9% last season and just 29.5% this season, with both seeing very similar drops.

The Kings will now play five of their next seven games against teams that rank in the top eight defensively. That stretch starts with a rest-disadvantage game against the top-ranked Thunder on Monday.

The Pacers have lost their last five road games, including three last week that they trailed by more than 20 points. But they returned home to get a win over the last-place Wizards on Sunday.
Three takeaways

That win over the Wizards wasn’t a guarantee, because the Pacers were previously 1-3 in games played between the nine Eastern Conference teams that are currently at least three games below .500. That includes a loss in Toronto last Monday in which the Raptors became the second team to make at least 10 corner 3-pointers in a game this season. Indiana still has two more wins against the two more wins against the top six teams in the East (4-5) than they do against the bottom nine (2-3).


The Pacers have scored just 101.6 points per 100 possessions over the five straight road losses, with Tyrese Haliburton having shot just 17-for-64 (27%) over the five games. That includes 8-for-20 in the paint and 0-for-8 from mid-range. Overall, his 2-point percentage (47.6%) and 3-point percentage (30.7%) are both the lowest marks of his career by wide margins.


They never made it a one-possession game, but the Wizards were within five points in the last five minutes on Sunday. So the Pacers remain the only team without a non-clutch win, with all seven having been within five in the last five.

The win over the Wizards began a stretch where the Pacers are playing eight of nine games against teams that are currently (like themselves) at least three games below .500. But they are one of the four teams that the Pelicans (who are in Indiana on Monday) have beat, having been on the other side of New Orleans’ best offensive performance of the season.

After losing the first two games of a five-game trip, the Blazers got a clutch win in Houston on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Overall, the Blazers have been only slightly better defensively with Deandre Ayton off the floor. But they’ve allowed just 105.4 points per 100 possessions over these last six games he’s missed, down from 116.1 per 100 over the 11 he played in. That includes just 99.0 per 100 with Donovan Clingan (who leads the league with 4.6 blocks per 36 minutes) on the floor.


Four of the Blazers’ last five games have been within five minutes, and they’ve scored 41 points on 28 clutch possessions (1.46 per) over that stretch, with Shaedon Sharpe, Anfernee Simons and Jerami Grant shooting a combined 10-for-14 on clutch shots. Simons’ go-ahead bucket with 28 seconds left in Houston on Saturday was a rather audacious step-back 3 over Fred VanVleet.


Of course, while four of the Blazers’ seven wins have been by single digits, they have five losses by 23 points or more. Portland is 7-10 with the point differential (-7.5 points per game) of a team that’s 4-13.

Two of the teams with the biggest discrepancies in the other direction (fewer wins than expected from their point differential) are the Grizzlies and Mavs. The Blazers will face both of them this week, also completing a five-game trip with just their second game against the Eastern Conference. Clingan (knee sprain) is out for their game in Memphis on Monday.

The Nets helped the Sixers end a five-game losing streak, but they picked up wins against the Hornets and Kings and are one of six Eastern Conference teams with seven wins.
Three takeaways

Cam Thomas remains the Nets’ leading scorer, but they wouldn’t have a top-10 offense if other guys weren’t putting the ball in the basket. Cameron Johnson had 71 total points against Charlotte and Philly last week and is registering career-high marks in 2-point percentage (60.7%), 3-point percentage (42.6%) and free throw percentage (90.6%).


The Nets’ biggest on-off differentials belong to Dorian Finney-Smith and Dennis Schröder, and they’ve outscored their opponents by 9.9 points per 100 possessions in 312 total minutes with both on the floor. But they won in Sacramento on Sunday without both of them, and with Ben Simmons and Nic Claxton starting together. The victory was just the fifth time they’ve allowed fewer than 110 points per 100 possessions.


The rest of the Eastern Conference is just 21-43 (.328) against the West, but the Nets are 4-1, with the only loss having come (to the Nuggets) in overtime. Of course, the four wins have also come by a total of just 22 points.

The second half of the Nets’ four-game trip will be tougher than the first half, especially if Kevin Durant is available for the Suns on Wednesday. That’s the second half of a back-to-back for Phoenix (and a rest-advantage game for the Nets), so maybe not. Brooklyn will be at a disadvantage in San Francisco on Monday night.

The Bulls are 1-7 against the Western Conference, but have the best record (3-1) in games played between the nine East teams that are at least three games below .500.
Three takeaways

Last week brought the Bulls’ three most efficient offensive performances of the season, wins over the Pistons and Hawks and a rest-disadvantage loss to the Grizzlies. Nikola Vučević is never going to get to the line much, but he has the highest effective field goal percentage (65.3%) among 68 players with at least 200 field goal attempts. He’s taken 59% of his shots in the paint, his highest rate in the last six seasons.


Three minutes into the first quarter of their loss in Milwaukee on Wednesday, the Bulls had a defensive possession that looked like it was the last game of a four-hour pick-up run. The rest of the game wasn’t quite that bad, but they’ve allowed more than 125 points per 100 possessions over their last six games, even though only two of the six opponents have shot better than 37% from 3-point range.


The Bulls are one of two teams — the Pelicans are the other — in the bottom five in both opponent field goal percentage in the paint (60.5%, 29th) and the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come in the paint (51%, highest in the league).

Tuesday will bring the first of four meetings with the Wizards, but the Bulls will play two of the three best teams in the East after that, and they’ll be at a rest disadvantage in Orlando on Wednesday night.

The Hawks got healthier last week, with Bogdan Bogdanović playing for the first time since opening night. They beat his former team (the shorthanded Kings) in his return, but that was their only victory on a four-game trip.
Three takeaways

Overall, the Hawks have lost five of their last seven games, with four of the five losses coming vs. the Bulls (x 2), Pistons and Blazers. They’ve played the league’s fifth easiest schedule in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage, but are just 5-7 against other teams that currently have losing records.


De’Andre Hunter has been back for four of the last five games, but he continues to come off the bench behind No. 1 pick Zaccharie Risacher. The Hawks have outscored their opponents by 6.0 points per 100 possessions in 223 total minutes with the other four starters on the floor, but have been outscored by 9.8 per 100 in 593 minutes with at least one of the four off the floor.


Trae Young shot just 2-for-16 from 3-point range over the last three games of the road trip. His value has always been about his playmaking and free throws more than his shooting from the field and the Hawks have still been at their best offensively with him on the floor. But that on-court mark (112.4 points scored per 100 possessions) is below the league average and Young’s effective field goal percentage of 46.6% would be the lowest mark of his career.

At 2-1 in the NBA Cup with a win over the Celtics, the Hawks are in first place in East Group C, though they’ll need to beat the Cavs (in their second of two meetings this week) to ensure a trip to the quarterfinals.

With an overtime victory over the Pistons on Thursday, the Hornets have won four straight games at home. But they’ve lost seven straight on the road, and they’ve also lost another big man to injury.
Three takeaways

With Miles Bridges missing the last two games, both Brandon Miller (38 points vs. Detroit) and LaMelo Ball (50 in Milwaukee) registered career-highs. Miller was 8-for-12 from 3-point range, but that was also the only game this season that he’s taken less than half of his shots from beyond the arc. He attempted more 2-pointers than 3-pointers in 45 (61%) of his 74 games last season.


Ball had never had a 40-point game before, but his usage rate this season (37.4%) would be the sixth highest for any player in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data, and it’s at 39.2% over the Hornets last eight games. He also had 10 assists on Saturday, but his assist ratio for the season (18.5 per 100 possessions used) would be the lowest mark of his career by a wide margin.


Grant Williams tore his ACL late in the fourth quarter on Saturday, leaving Moussa Diabaté and Taj Gibson as the Hornets’ only healthy bigs. They had outscored their opponents by 15.1 points per 100 possession in 222 minutes with Williams at the four (alongside Diabaté, Gibson or Nick Richards), but struggled (minus-9.7 per 100) in his minutes at the five.

The good news is that the Hornets now begin a five-game homestand. One of their three home losses this season was to the Heat, but they’ll have a rest advantage against Miami on Wednesday.

At 7-8 with games against the Bulls and Hornets early last week, the Pistons had a great opportunity to climb over .500. But they’ve lost three straight to fall from fifth to 11th in the East.
Three takeaways

The three-game losing streak has been the Pistons’ worst three-game stretch of defense (120.7 points allowed per 100 possessions) by a healthy margin, even though the three opponents — Chicago, Charlotte and Orlando — rank no higher than 17th offensively. The Bulls and Hornets combined to shoot 43-for-90 (48%) from 3-point range, while the Magic clobbered the Pistons on the offensive glass.


Detroit still ranks as the league’s fifth most-improved defensive team, having allowed 5.9 fewer points per 100 possessions than it did last season. They’re one of five teams that have ranked in the bottom 10 defensively in each of the last three years.


Cade Cunningham (left hip injury) missed overtime in Charlotte and the Pistons’ loss in Orlando, exposing the fact that Marcus Sasser is the only other point guard on the roster. Malik Beasley started at the point on Saturday and the Pistons have scored just 104.7 points per 100 possessions in Cunningham’s 261 minutes off the floor.

The Pistons are one of four teams that haven’t had a rest-advantage game, with their first on Monday (with Cunningham listed as doubtful) against the Raptors. They’re still undefeated in the NBA Cup, set to visit the 0-2 Pacers (to whom they lost on opening night) on Friday.

The Raptors doubled their win total last week, beating the Pacers and Wolves at home behind 70 total points from RJ Barrett.
Three takeaways

With those two big games last week, Barrett has as many games of at least 30 points on a true shooting percentage of 70% or better in less than a year with the Raptors (five) as he had in four-plus seasons with the Knicks (five). His efficiency is still down dramatically from last season, but maybe Scottie Barnes can help.


Barnes returned from an 11-game absence on Thursday, and he had a solid line (18 points, seven rebounds, seven assists, three steals and 12 free throw attempts) in the Raptors’ loss in Cleveland over the weekend. But Toronto was outscored by 20 points in 51 minutes with Barnes and Barrett on the floor together over the two games.


Ochai Agbaji leads the league with 24 corner 3-pointers on 55% shooting, but the Raptors have outscored their opponents with him off the floor. He was in the starting lineup for the 12th straight game on Sunday, but the Raptors fell into a double-digit deficit early and Davion Mitchell (with Immanuel Quickly missing his sixth straight game) started the second half instead of Agbaji. Barnes, Barrett and Quickley sill haven’t played together this season.

The Raptors’ loss in Cleveland on Sunday was the start of a four-game trip, and they’ll be at a rest disadvantage in Detroit on Monday night. They lost their first meeting with the Pistons when Gradey Dick missed two 3-pointers in the final 24 seconds.

The Sixers got a win over Ben Simmons and the Nets on Friday, but still can’t get all three of their stars on the floor together and still have the second worst record in the league.
Three takeaways

After playing four out of five games, Joel Embiid has missed the last two with his lingering left knee issue. When Tyrese Maxey returned from a six-game absence on Wednesday, Paul George re-injured his left knee in the first minute of the third quarter. Through their first 16 games, the Sixers’ three stars have played a total of six minutes and seven seconds together.


Maxey scored 26 points in the win over Brooklyn, with 14 of those coming at the rim. Jared McCain added 30 and has now averaged 25.1 over the last eight games. But the Sixers scored just 104.7 points per 100 possessions in 42 total minutes with their three healthy starters — Maxey, McCain and Caleb Martin — on the floor last week.


Prior to this season, eight (6%) of the 125 teams to lose at least 13 of their first 16 games went on to make the playoffs. That includes the 2010-11 Sixers, who finished as the No. 7 seed at 41-41. The last team to do it was ’21-22 Pelicans, who were 2-14 after 16 games, finished 36-46 (ninth in the West), and qualified via the Play-In.

The good news is that the Sixers have just two games over the next eight days, and they’re both rest-advantage games, though they went 0-2 with rest advantages (and Embiid in the lineup) last week.

After an 0-4 road trip, the Jazz returned home and ended the Knicks’ four-game winning streak on Saturday afternoon.
Three takeaways

After shooting just 31% from 3-point range over their previous three games, the Jazz were 19-for-34 (56%) on Saturday. Eleven of those 19 3s came from Collin Sexton (6-for-8) and Lauri Markkanen (5-for-8), who have now shot a combined 45% from beyond the arc for the season (while the rest of the Jazz have shot 31%). The Jazz have scored a pretty potent 120.4 points per 100 possessions in 131 minutes with Sexton and Markkanen on the floor with John Collins.


The Jazz continue to give up a ton of points in transition, with the Knicks scoring 38 of their 106 points in transition on Saturday. The 31.8 transition points per game they’ve allowed would destroy the Rockets’ record (in 21 seasons of Synergy tracking) of 27.2 two seasons ago.


What’s wild is that, overall, only 48% of their opponents’ shots (the league’s 12th-lowest opponent rate) have come in the paint. According to Second Spectrum tracking, the Jazz have allowed a league-low 41.5 drives per 100 possessions.

Jazz players not named Sexton or Markkanen were a combined 5-for-27 from 3-point range when they lost their lone rest-disadvantage game of the season (eight days ago against the Clippers). They’ll have rest disadvantages against the Nuggets and Lakers as they finish up a five-game homestand this week.

The Pelicans remain depleted, starting Elfrid Payton at point guard just hours after he was signed on Wednesday (when Brandon Ingram missed a game for the first time).
Three takeaways

After getting clobbered by the Mavs and Cavs, the Pelicans went down to the wire against the Warriors on Friday. But Ingram missed a pair of critical free throws and then passed up a seemingly open corner 3 with a chance to tie in the final seconds. Only six of the Pelicans’ 17 games have been within five points in the last five minutes, but they’ve used 13 different players in clutch time and have had more guys play at least 25 total minutes for them (19) than they did all of last season (16).


The loss to Golden State did end a streak of seven straight games in which the Pelicans registered an effective field goal percentage no better than 50%. Trey Murphy III missed a 3 for the tie after Ingram passed up that look from the corner, but had his best offensive game of the five he’s played, scoring 24 points on 9-for-17 shooting.


Rookie Antonio Reeves scored 34 points (more than he has in his other nine games combined) in Cleveland on Wednesday. The 47th pick in last year’s Draft is just 8-for-28 (29%) from 3-point range, but a solid 13-for-22 (59%) in the paint, with some deft finishes inside against the Cavs.

The Pels have a league-low four rest-advantage games this season, with the first coming on Monday in Indiana, where the Pacers beat the Wizards on Sunday night. CJ McCollum (out the last 13 games) and Dejounte Murray (out since opening night) are listed as questionable and doubtful, respectively, so even if they don’t play, they’re getting close to a return.

The Wizards were competitive with the Celtics for about 45 minutes on Friday, but their losing streak is at 11 games.
Three takeaways

Malcolm Brogdon has played in the last four games, starting the last three. But the veteran point guard hasn’t sparked much improvement, with the Wizards scoring just 96.9 points per 100 possessions in his 92 minutes on the floor.


They have outscored their opponents by 11 points in 31 minutes (small-sample-size alert) with Brogdon on the floor with fellow vet Jonas Valančiūnas, but the big man continues to come off the bench behind Alex Sarr. The rookie did have one of his better games (17 points, 14 rebounds and two blocks) in Indiana on Sunday.


Only three of the Wizards’ 13 losses have been within five points in the last five minutes and in none of those three games did they have a clutch offensive possession, because every time they got within five, the other team scored. Overall (including a clutch win over the Hawks), they’ve allowed 21 points on 14 clutch defensive possessions.

The Wizards are the only team that hasn’t played a rest-disadvantage game, and their first is Wednesday, when they complete a home back-to-back with a visit from the Clippers. They have a 20-game losing streak in the second games of back-to-backs, with the last win having come (behind a big game from Kristaps Porzingis) in February of 2023.

The Cavs lost two games to the Hawks last week but avenged their other loss (to the Celtics) with a furious finish on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The two losses to the Hawks were different. The first was the Cavs’ worst defensive game of the season (135 points allowed on 105 possessions), while the second was their worst offensive game (101 scored on 103). One issue in both games was corner 3-pointers, with the Hawks shooting 15-for-27 (56%) from the corners over the home-and-home set. Only three teams have allowed more corner 3-pointers per game than the Cavs (4.2).


Donovan Mitchell shot just 15-for-47 (6-for-24 from 3-point range) over the two losses but went nuts down the stretch on Sunday. He drained three straight 3-pointers to tie the game, hit a floater to put the Cavs up two, and then drew two to the ball, allowing a rolling Isaac Okoro to assist Evan Mobley for another huge bucket. The Cavs are now 13-0 when Mitchell has had an effective field goal percentage higher than 50% (and 4-3 when he hasn’t).


The Cavs trailed the Celtics by 12 at the end of the third quarter, but scored 43 points on 26 possessions (1.65 per) in the fourth, going 10-for-10 at the free throw line in the final 22 seconds. They’re now 4-3 (every other team has a losing record) when trailing after the third period.

The Cavs have two games left on a stretch where they will have played eight of 10 at home. They’re 4-0 against the Western Conference and will face another West test when the Nuggets come to Cleveland on Thursday.

Kristaps Porziņģis made his season debut last week and the Celtics ran their winning streak to seven games before suffering a fourth-quarter collapse in Cleveland on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Porziņģis averaged 19.3 points and 7.3 rebounds (in 26.6 minutes) over his first three games back. The Celtics increasingly worked him into the offense, posting him up once in his debut against the Clippers, five times in Chicago, and then nine times in Cleveland.


Their win in Chicago on Friday was the Celtics’ first (and only) game with their entire rotation, with both Derrick White and Jaylen Brown missing the loss in Cleveland. They played nine guys, though Neemias Queta got just 6:35 of playing time off the bench. The starting lineup was solid, but Payton Pritchard had an incredible game (29 points, 7-for-11 from 3-point range) off the bench. Pritchard (64.8%) and Derrick White (61.8%) rank third and fourth in effective field goal percentage among 90 players with at least 200 field goal attempts, with only a pair of centers – Domantas Sabonis and Nikola Vučević – ahead of them.


Despite Pritchard’s potent shooting, the Celtics’ bench hasn’t been quite as good as it was last season when it was the highest-rated bench in the 28 years for which we have play-by-play data. It still ranks fourth this season, but Boston has been outscored by 1.3 points per 100 possessions with Jayson Tatum off the floor. Other teams would probably love to be so mediocre with their best player on the bench, but last season, the Celtics were plus 12.4 per 100 with Tatum off the floor.

The Celtics’ loss in Cleveland on Sunday was the start of their first stretch of five games in seven days, though the next four are all at home. They’re done with Emirates NBA Cup pool play, but have a shot at the East wildcard, depending on the point differentials of the losers of Magic-Knicks and Bucks-Pistons on Tuesday.

The Rockets are heading to the Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals, having clinched West Group A with their overtime win in Minnesota on Tuesday. They’re now 12-3 since their 3-3 start to the season, picking up a huge win over Oklahoma City on Sunday. That puts them just a half-game behind the first-place Thunder in the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

All three of their games last week went down to the wire, even though the Rockets had double-digit leads in each. They’ve been the league’s third-best first-quarter team (plus 15 per 100 possessions), having won the opening period in 15 of their 21 games. That includes a 33-28 first quarter against the Thunder (one of two teams that have been better in the first quarter overall) on Sunday.


On Wednesday, Jalen Green scored 18 of the team’s 35 first-quarter points in Philadelphia, finishing with 41. It was a nice response after he played 23 minutes the night before in Minnesota, though the fourth-year guard is still registering a career-low true shooting percentage of 52.1% and the Rockets have still been at their best (plus-14.8 per 100 possessions) with him off the floor.


With the back-to-back, overtime wins in Minnesota and Philly, the Rockets are 6-3 on the road, with two of the three losses having come by three points or fewer. Last season, they didn’t get their sixth road win until March 2.

That road success will be tested this week as the Rockets take a three-game trip through California. They’re 2-1 against the Pacific Division, with the one loss (to the Warriors without Stephen Curry) having come in overtime after they erased a 31-point deficit.

After allowing just 102.3 points per 100 possessions over a four-game winning streak, the Thunder couldn’t get the stops they needed down the stretch in Houston on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Isaiah Hartenstein has started the last four games after coming off the bench in his first game. Though the loss on Sunday was one of their worst defensive games of the season, the Thunder have allowed less than a point per possession with Hartenstein on the floor and have outscored their opponents by 17.6 per 100 in his 86 total minutes alongside Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams.


Hartenstein has helped exactly where he was supposed to. He’s grabbed 19.8% of available rebounds when he’s been on the floor, the highest rate of his career by a healthy margin and the fourth-highest rate among 296 players who’ve averaged at least 15 minutes per game. Last week’s wins over the Kings and Lakers were two of the Thunder’s three best rebounding games of the season.


Cason Wallace got two straight starts over the weekend, though Isaiah Joe and Aaron Wiggins were both in the starting lineup earlier in the week. Wiggins has the worst on-court numbers of the three (minus-1.0 per 100 possessions) in minutes alongside Gilgeous-Alexander and Williams (though he’s also the only one of the three that’s shot more effectively as a starter than as a reserve).

The Thunders’ three opponents this week are a combined 14-48, and they’re 6-0 (the only undefeated team) against the 15 teams that are currently at or below .500, with all six wins having come by double-digits.

The Mavs have won eight of their last nine games and are currently 5-1 on a wild, nine-game, 16-day stretch that’s taking them from the West to the East … twice.
Three takeaways

The first five games of that West-to-East-to-West-to-East stretch came without Luka Dončić, and the Mavs have more wins without their star (5-1) than they had all of last season (4-8). Three of those five wins have come against the Thunder, Nuggets and Knicks, and the Mavs have scored more efficiently in those six games (117.7 points per 100 possessions) than they have in the 15 with Dončić in uniform.


Dončić’s absence created more playing time for Spencer Dinwiddie, who has taken advantage. The 10-year vet had three games of 20 points or more last week and has registered an assist/turnover ratio of 40/6 over the last eight games. Dončić returned on Sunday, but Kyrie Irving was out and Dinwiddie played more than 34 minutes off the bench, including almost 23 with Dončić on the floor as well.


Klay Thompson has also been out, missing the last four games with plantar fasciitis. Though Thompson has taken a career-high 65.1% of his shots from 3-point range, the Mavs (38.8%, 24th) have seen the league’s biggest drop in 3-point rate from last season (44.1%, second). They’ve still outscored their opponents by 69 points from beyond the arc over their four-game winning streak.

The Mavs are making another brief stop at home before heading back East to visit the Wizards and Raptors. With a strong point differential (and with the Warriors having already won their group), they’ll likely be the Western Conference wildcard in the Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals if they beat the Grizzlies (the first meeting between the two teams) on Tuesday.

After a 2-2 trip, the Clippers returned home and got a big win over the Nuggets on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Clippers’ top-five defense met some regression to the mean on Monday when the Celtics made 22 3-pointers after the Clippers’ previous three opponents made just 24 total. The Clippers and Grizzlies both rank in the top five in opponent 3-point percentage while having one of the league’s five highest opponent 3-point rates (3PA/FGA).


Norman Powell returned from a six-game absence on Sunday and gave the Clippers’ offense a huge lift, scoring 28 points in less than 25 minutes. The offense has been at its best at 113.4 points scored per 100 possessions with Powell on the floor, though the six games without him were a strong stretch defensively (100.7 allowed per 100), despite the 22 3-pointers from the Celtics.


Ivica Zubac picked up some of the offensive slack in Powell’s absence and has seen an increase in scoring each of the last five seasons. But this season’s jump is more about minutes (career-high 32.7 per game) than efficiency, as Zubac’s 60.7% shooting is his lowest mark in the last six years, while he’s also shooting a career-low 53.7% from the free throw line. James Harden’s 59 assists to Zubac are the most from any player to a single teammate.

After an 0-4 start, the Clippers have won eight straight at the Intuit Dome, and the rest of their four-game homestand includes big games against the Wolves (who they just lost to in Minnesota on Friday) and Rockets. They scored just 101.5 points per 100 possessions, with Powell shooting just 8-for-29 and Zubac scoring just 14 total points, as they lost two games in Houston in November.

After losing their first four games without Paolo Banchero, the Magic have gone 12-1, with two six-game winning streaks sandwiching a (road) loss to the Clippers.
Three takeaways

The last five wins have come against the bottom half of the Eastern Conference. The Magic have played a league-high 15 games against the 15 teams currently at or below .500. Their only two losses against that group (at Chicago and Indiana) came during the 0-5 road trip in which Banchero was injured.


Wendell Carter Jr. returned from a 12-game absence on Wednesday and (with Banchero still out) has been starting alongside Goga Bitadze for the last three games. The two bigs played just 17 minutes together all of last season, but are an amazing plus-54 in 56 total minutes together this season, with the Magic having allowed just 89.2 points per 100 possessions in those minutes.


Kentavious Caldwell-Pope’s shots are finally starting to fall. He’s made almost as many 3s in the last three games (14-for-24, 58%) as he had made prior (17-for-76, 22%). Orlando ranks fifth in the percentage of their 3-point attempts that have come off the catch (76%) and Caldwell-Pope’s shooting will gain importance as the Magic face tougher competition.

The Magic are almost guaranteed a spot in the NBA Cup quarterfinals. They play the Knicks for first place in East Group A on Tuesday, but (with a plus-60 point differential through their first three games) would certainly get the wildcard spot if they were to lose.

After a 12-3 start to the season, the Warriors have lost four straight games.
Three takeaways

All four losses have been within five points in the last five minutes, though the Warriors only got to within five after trailing by 17 in the fourth quarter in Phoenix on Saturday. During the losing streak, the Warriors have scored just six points on 18 clutch possessions (shooting 2-for-21), though most of that anemia (five points on 13 possessions) came in the one game (Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City) that Stephen Curry missed.


Curry returned on Saturday, when the Warriors made another lineup change, with Brandin Podziemski taking the spot previously occupied by Lindy Waters III. Of course, the new lineup played less than six minutes together and the Warriors still played 13 guys in the loss to the Suns.


The time to shorten the rotation may be right now (or three weeks ago). Over their last nine games, the Warriors have outscored their opponents by 14.5 points per 100 possessions in 220 minutes with Curry and Draymond Green on the floor together, but have been outscored by 4.6 per 100 in 80 minutes with one on the floor without the other and are a minus-21.5 per 100 in 132 minutes with neither on the floor.

It might also be time to shorten the rotation because the Warriors have four more big games within the Western Conference this week. The Nuggets swept the season series in each of the last two seasons (seven total games), and their first meeting this season is their Emirates NBA Cup finale in Denver on Tuesday.

It’s been a soft stretch of schedule, with each of the six games coming against teams that are currently at least three games under .500 (and five of the six coming at home). Overall, the Grizzlies have played the league’s most home-heavy schedule (13 of 21 at FedExForum) and the second easiest regarding cumulative opponent winning percentage (.432).


Ja Morant has been back (from an eight-game absence) for three of the last four games. He’s averaged just 26.1 minutes since his return, but nobody on the Grizzlies has played big minutes, as they’ve gone 11 deep in the rotation. Morant, Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr. have still played just 63 total minutes together, with the Grizzlies having outscored their opponents by 29 points per 100 possessions in those minutes.


Marcus Smart has been back for four games and continues to come off the bench, with Jaylen Wells in the starting lineup. The situation seems to work well for both guys, as they’ve combined for an effective field goal percentage of 68.1% over the winning streak.

The Mavs were without Luka Dončić on Wednesday, but still had their most efficient offensive game of the season (129 points on 98 possessions) against the Knicks’ bottom-10 defense. Jalen Brunson scored an efficient 37 points against his old team, but the Knicks are 0-5 (and 0-3 when Brunson plays) against the Mavs since he arrived from Dallas.


Mikal Bridges had his best offensive game of the season on Sunday, scoring 31 points on 12-for-19 shooting (7-for-12 from 3-point range) against the Pelicans, and he’s back in the league lead with 31 corner 3-pointers. But OG Anunoby has finally cooled off, shooting 0-for-15 from beyond the arc (and just 8-for-21 inside it) over the last three games. He’s still one of only two players – Victor Wembanyama is the other – with at least 30 dunks and 30 3-pointers this season.


The Knicks — for a second straight season — are one of the teams most dependent on a strong start. Their win in Charlotte on Friday was just their second in a game (they’re now 2-8) where they didn’t win the first quarter, but after winning the first period vs. the Pelicans by 23 points on Sunday, they’re 10-0 when they’ve held the lead after 12 minutes.

The Knicks’ only regular-season home loss with Anunoby in the lineup last season was to the Magic, who are back at Madison Square Garden for a big Emirates NBA Cup game on Tuesday. The winner wins East Group A, while also getting an important win in regard to the overall Eastern Conference standings.

The Nuggets are still two games over .500, but it’s been three weeks since they won two straight.
Three takeaways

The Nuggets got Aaron Gordon back from a 10-game absence on Sunday. He came off the bench (as part of an eight-man rotation) and the Nuggets outscored their opponent with Nikola Jokić off the floor for just the second time (in the 15 games Jokić has played) this season. But they blew a 10-point, second-half lead to the Clippers and scored just seven points (with Jokić shooting 0-for-2 and committing a turnover) on nine clutch possessions.


Christian Braun is benefitting from playing alongside Jokić more than he did last season. If you take away the three games that Jokic has missed, the reigning Kia MVP has been on the floor for 92% of Braun’s minutes. But the third-year guard also deserves some credit for having seen a huge leap in efficiency, registering a true shooting percentage of 68.2%, up from 55.4% last season. Braun has seen a big drop in 3-point rate (3PA/FGA) but improved in 2-point percentage, 3-point percentage and free throw rate (FTA/FGA).


The Knicks scored 145 points on 100 possessions, the second most efficient performance for any team this season, last Monday. Then the Clippers had their third most efficient game of the season (126 on 102) over the weekend. With those losses, the Nuggets are 4-6 (2-4 at home) in games played between the 15 teams that currently have winning records.

They’ll face two more top-tier teams for the first time this week. The Nuggets are back home for just one game, hosting the Warriors (against whom they’ve won seven straight) on Tuesday. Then they begin a three-game (or four-game) trip in Cleveland two nights later.

The Suns ended their five-game losing streak with the returns of Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal last week. They got important wins over the Lakers and Warriors, though they also fell to the Nets in between.
Three takeaways

The Suns are now 10-2 with Durant and 1-6 without him, with the much bigger difference (10.7 points per 100 possessions) continuing to be on defense. Even in his three games back, they’ve allowed 9.7 fewer points per 100 possessions with him on the floor (104.7) than they have with him on the bench (114.4).


Opponents have shot just 38.4% on shots that Durant has defended, with the expected field goal percentage on those shots being 46.9%. That’s the fifth-biggest differential among 261 players who’ve defended at least 100 total shots this season.


Beal was back for less than two games, turning his ankle in the fourth quarter of the loss to Brooklyn and missing the Suns’ win over the Warriors over the weekend. The Suns are 7-2 when they’ve had all three of their stars, but have outscored their opponents by just 0.8 points per 100 possessions in their 169 minutes on the floor together. That number was plus 6.6 per 100 last season.

The Suns are the only Western Conference team that made the Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals last year and is still alive with one night of Cup action remaining. (The Lakers, Pelicans and Kings have all been eliminated.) Even if they beat the Spurs on Tuesday, they’ll need some help elsewhere to win Group B or to qualify as the wildcard for a second straight season.

The Lakers will not be defending their Emirates NBA Cup title in Las Vegas, having suffered their first two Cup losses ever last week. But they did get an important win in San Antonio (ending a three-game losing streak) in between.
Three takeaways

The Lakers made another change to their starting lineup last week, replacing Cam Reddish with rookie Dalton Knecht (averaging 18 points on an effective field goal percentage of 64% in eight total games as a starter). The new starting lineup was outscored by 14 points by the Spurs and Thunder in 18 minutes last week, with Austin Reaves suffering an injury and missing the Lakers’ win in Utah on Sunday.


While the most recent starting groups haven’t had much success, the Lakers have seen dramatic improvement from their bench. They had the league’s 24th-ranked bench at the point (Nov. 8) that D’Angelo Russell was taken out of the starting lineup. Since then, their bench ranks fourth, with Russell having shot a little more effectively as a reserve (51.8%) than he did as a starter (45.5%). He scored 17 points on 7-for-11 shooting in the San Antonio win.


They also got good bench minutes without Russell in Utah on Sunday, when the Lakers won despite shooting 7-for-33 (21%) from 3-point range. There have been only seven games this season where a team has won while making fewer than eight 3-pointers, with the Lakers (two), Rockets (two) and Raptors (two) accounting for six of those seven wins.

The win in Utah on Sunday started a four-game trip that will take the Lakers to Miami and Atlanta. They’re 3-3 (1-2 on the road) against the Eastern Conference.

The Spurs appear legit, having climbed above .500 and staying there with a comeback win in Sacramento on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Spurs are a second-half team, 18.3 points per 100 possessions better after halftime (plus-9.2, fourth best) than before halftime (minus-9.1, third worst). They’ve lost the first quarter in each of their last six games (and by double-digits three times in that stretch), but have won five of the six.


The bigger difference between the first-half Spurs and the second-half Spurs has been on offense and has been as much about free throw rate and turnover rate as it’s been about shooting. Among the six Spurs with at least 50 field goal attempts before and after halftime, Julian Champagnie has the biggest differential in effective field goal percentage (51.0% in the first half, 62.5% in the second half).


Overall, the Spurs rank as the league’s second-most-improved team regarding winning percentage and its fifth-most-improved team regarding point differential per 100 possessions.

The Spurs will win West Group B if they win their NBA Cup finale in Phoenix on Tuesday. It’s their first meeting with the Suns, who they beat three times last season. It’s also an opportunity for Victor Wembanyama to go head-to-head with Kevin Durant, the Suns’ primary defender on Wembanyama in the three games the reigning Kia Rookie of the Year played against the Suns in 2023-24.

The Bucks have won six straight games to climb over .500 and into the top six in the Eastern Conference.
Three takeaways

The Bucks have scored more than 120 points per 100 possessions in each of their last five games, with Giannis Antetokounmpo averaging 38 points and nine assists (in less than 35 minutes) in the four that he played. His 33.7 points per 36 minutes would be the 10th-highest mark in NBA history (minimum 500 minutes played) and make Antetokounmpo the only player with three spots in the top 10.


The Bucks’ Emirates NBA Cup win in Miami on Tuesday came without Antetokounmpo and was also their first road win since opening night (in Philadelphia). It was the second slowest-paced game of the season, but Damian Lillard scored 37 points, shooting 8-for-13 from 3-point range, including 6-for-11 on pull-up 3-pointers. The 1.11 points per possession he’s scored as a pick-and-roll ball-handler this season is up from 0.99 last season and ranks third among 41 players who’ve averaged at least five ball-handler possessions per game, according to Synergy tracking.


The win in Miami was also a reminder that if Antetokounmpo isn’t scoring in the paint, the Bucks aren’t scoring in the paint. The points in the paint total was 46-18 in favor of the Heat, who were also a plus-9 at the free throw line. Antetokounmpo’s 22.1 points in the paint per game are 5.2 more than any player has averaged this season (and would be the most for any player in the last 25 years), but as a team, the Bucks rank 25th with 43.9 points in the paint per game.

The Bucks are one of three Eastern Conference teams — the Celtics and Knicks are the others — with a chance to make the NBA Cup quarterfinals for a second straight year. They’ll play the Pistons for first place in East Group B on Tuesday, having edged Detroit in overtime (with Antetokounmpo scoring 59 points) in their first meeting.

The Wolves are three games into a pretty big stretch of seven straight against teams within the top 12 in the Western Conference. After dropping games to the Rockets and Kings, they got a much-needed (and narrow) win over the Clippers on Friday.
Three takeaways

The Timberwolves were up 12 with a little more than seven minutes to go on Wednesday, having gone on a 28-9 run that felt bigger than just those 11 last minutes like it could be the spark that turns their season around. Then, that 12-point lead turned into an 11-point loss (at home) to the Kings, with Sacramento scoring (26 points) on 11 straight possessions at one point. Each of the Wolves’ last eight games (3-5) have been within five points in the last five minutes.


While that was a brutal defensive stretch against the Kings, the Wolves’ larger issues have been on offense, with the last five games (105.9 points scored per 100 possessions) being their worst stretch of the season on that end of the floor. Four of their top eight guys combined to shoot 19-for-82 (23%) from 3-point range over the losing streak.


Their win over the Clippers on Friday wasn’t pretty overall (they committed 22 turnovers), but the Wolves did shoot 15-for-39 (38%) from beyond the arc, improving to 9-3 when they’ve shot 36% or better from 3-point range. They’re 0-7 when they haven’t. The Wizards (0-14) are the only other winless team when shooting below 36% from deep.

This big stretch of games within the West continues this week, and the Wolves will have a rest advantage in each of their next three. They’re 2-1 (1-1 at home) in rest-advantage games thus far.

The Heat had a brief stay in the land above .500 by winning four out of five, but couldn’t complete and home-and-home sweep of the Raptors, getting outscored by 22 points in the paint (68-46) as they fell in Toronto on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Heat are in the middle of the pack offensively and need to get stops to get wins. They’re 9-0 when they’ve allowed fewer than 116 points per 100 possessions and 0-9 when they’ve allowed 116 or more.


After missing two games, Terry Rozier has come off the bench for the last four (he started the first 12). But he was on the floor down the stretch of the three games that were within five points in the last five minutes last week. He was officially 3-for-3 in the clutch, but his long 3 to tie the Heat’s game against the Bucks on Tuesday was both off the mark and a little bit late. At 83-for-206 (40.3%), Rozier is still one of only three players — Mike Miller and Ben Gordon are others — who’ve shot 40% or better on at least 200 clutch 3-point attempts (including playoffs) over the 29 seasons for which we have clutch data.


The Heat still needs more from Rozier in his reserve role. Jimmy Butler has played the last six games and the Heat have scored 26.4 more points per 100 possessions in Butler’s 202 minutes on the floor (119.6) than they have in his 91 minutes on the bench (93.2).

The Heat are the only East team that has yet to face the Celtics or Cavs, and they’ll face them both this week, visiting Boston on Monday and hosting Cleveland over the weekend. Both games will be the second games of back-to-backs for both the Heat and the opponents.

The Hawks have won three straight games for the first time, beating the Cavs twice and clinching East Group C along the way.
Three takeaways

De’Andre Hunter has scored a team-high 67 points in just 83 minutes off the bench over the three-game winning streak. For the season, he’s shot a career-best 40.4% from 3-point range while also registering a career-best free throw rate of 37.1 attempts per 100 shots from the field.


Despite Hunter’s scoring binge, the Hawks still have the league’s 26th-ranked bench, having been outscored by 14.2 points per 100 possessions in Jalen Johnson’s 279 total minutes off the floor. They lost a rest-advantage game to the Mavs last Monday when they were outscored by 13 in Johnson’s 11 minutes on the bench.


Zaccharie Risacher might be starting to figure things out, having shot 16-for-28 (57%) over the winning streak. He flourishes in transition (where 15 of his 42 points over these three games have come) and moves well without the ball, fitting in well with an offense that ranks in the top seven in both ball and player movement. One bucket against the Cavs on Friday was an impressive display of patience in the face of multiple defenders.

The Hawks have a great opportunity to extend the winning streak and return to .500 for the first time since they were 2-2, hosting the Pelicans on Monday. That’s one of three games this week in which they’ll have a rest advantage, with a visit from the Lakers on Friday being the lone exception.

The Nets went 3-0 out West, knocking off the Warriors and Suns last week. Unfortunately, the schedule didn’t allow for them to keep on beating up on the Western Conference, and they returned home to lose two games to the Magic.
Three takeaways

The Nets are now 6-1 (with the only loss having come in overtime) against the West and 3-11 against the East, a remarkable split given the state of the two conferences. They had just eight wins against the West last season.


Cam Thomas is out for at least a few weeks with a hamstring strain. That hurts the Nets’ shot creation and while the Nets’ got a surprise, 30-point performance from Tyrese Martin (who had 33 total points in 21 career games prior) in Phoenix on Wednesday, their two losses to the Magic over the weekend were two of their three least efficient offensive performances of the season. Dennis Schröder missed the first one and shot just 6-for-19 (with six turnovers) on Sunday.


The Nets are the only team that ranks in the bottom five in both offensive and defensive rebounding percentage. They’ve grabbed no more than 50% of available boards in each of their last 10 games.

More Eastern Conference games are coming this week, though two of the three are against two of the three East teams — the Bulls and Bucks — that the Nets have beaten. They’ll have a rest advantage against Indiana on Wednesday.

The Kings got a (seemingly) good win in Minnesota on Wednesday, but that’s their only victory in their last seven games.
Three takeaways

That game in Minnesota was a wild, back-and-forth affair in which the Kings blew a 14-point lead, but then came back from 12 points down in the fourth quarter with a 29-6 run to close the game. They’re one of two teams with multiple wins (they’re 2-8) when trailing by more than 10 points in the fourth.


Malik Monk was the leading scorer (11 points) in that 29-6 run, two nights after he returned from a seven-game absence. And on Sunday (when DeMar DeRozan returned from two games out), Monk was in the starting lineup for the first time in 170 career games with the Kings. The Kings got off to a great start, but eventually blew a 17-point lead and couldn’t get stops down the stretch, allowing the Spurs to score 16 points on nine clutch possessions. There hasn’t been much beam lighting with the Kings now 4-7 (with four straight losses) at home.


Now 2-7 in games decided by five points or fewer, the Kings are 9-12 with a positive point differential (better than those of the Lakers and Suns).

It would have been nice to get that win against the Spurs, because the Kings will now face the second-place Rockets and third-place Grizzlies for the first time, seeing the Spurs again in San Antonio on Friday.

The Pacers won the first three games of their four-game homestand, but lost the finale to the Pistons (without Cade Cunningham) and, after a loss in Memphis on Sunday, they’ve now lost six straight (and nine of the last 10) on the road.
Three takeaways

The three straight wins came over Washington, New Orleans and Portland, so they didn’t exactly signal a breakthrough for the Pacers. The Portland win was slow-paced and their second-most efficient offensive performance of the season, but the offense was worse than average again in the two losses over the weekend. Plus, the Pacers aren’t very good at winning ugly. Over the last two seasons, they’re 6-35 when scoring less than 115 points per 100 possessions.


Aaron Nesmith and Ben Sheppard remain out, but the Pacers did get Andrew Nembhard back from a 12-game absence on Sunday. He played less than 15 minutes but managed to register 14 points, four assists and two steals in that time. The Pacers have outscored their opponents by 8.9 points per 100 possessions in 141 minutes with their four currently healthy starters on the floor together.


The flip side of that is that the Pacers have had the league’s 24th-ranked bench, having been outscored by 14.4 points per 100 possessions with Pascal Siakam off the floor.

The Pacers will try to resolve their road woes as their four-game trip takes them through Toronto, Brooklyn and Chicago. They were in Toronto two weeks ago and allowed the Raptors to shoot 59% in a double-digit defeat.

The Bulls’ fast pace continues to make it tough for them to keep up with the best teams in the league. They got a win in Washington on Tuesday but then allowed almost 130 points per 100 possessions in losses to Orlando and Boston.
Three takeaways

The Bulls are one of two teams that rank in the top six in both 3-point percentage (38.3%, sixth) and the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range (47.2%, fifth). Their 16.4 made 3-pointers per game would be the fifth most in NBA history. But on Friday, they ran into the team — the Celtics — that would have the record by a huge margin and got outscored, 69-60, from beyond the arc in a nine-point loss.


With that loss to the Celtics, the Bulls are just 2-7 (only the Jazz and Wizards have been worse) at home, having allowed more than 120 points per 100 possessions over those nine games. Those nine opponents have a cumulative winning percentage of .650, and the Bulls have only once had two straight home games.


Talen Horton-Tucker has been the 11th man (sixth reserve to see minutes) of late but has scored 59 points (on 22-for-28 shooting) in less than 61 minutes over the last four games. For the season, the Bulls have the league’s 22nd-ranked bench, having been outscored by 10.2 points per 100 possessions in Zach LaVine’s 400 minutes off the floor.

The Blazers keep picking up some unexpected victories, though their four-game home winning streak ended with a loss to the Mavs on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Blazers lost Donovan Clingan and Robert Williams III to injury before getting Deandre Ayton back from a seven-game absence on Wednesday. They’ve only twice had all three centers available. Ayton shot 26-for-40 (65%) in his three games back last week, with almost all of that production (24-for-31) coming in the paint. Ayton was a good mid-range shooter (51.2%) last season but hasn’t taken as many shots (and hasn’t shot as well) from mid-range this year.


The Blazers should hope that one of their two as-yet-unscheduled games isn’t against the Grizzlies, who they’re only scheduled to play three times total as of now. They did not avenge their 45-point loss from earlier in November when they visited Memphis last Monday. Instead, they lost by 25, never holding a lead and shooting just 8-for-46 (17%) from 3-point range.


For the season the Blazers rank 24th in 3-point percentage, having shot below 20% from deep a league-high three times (including both games against Memphis). Over the weekend, they somehow won a game shooting 11-for-37 (30%) and lost a game shooting 18-for-31 (58%) from deep.

Overall, they’re 6-4 when they’ve shot 36% or better from 3-point range and 2-9 when they haven’t. One of those wins where the Blazers shot well from beyond the arc was in L.A. against the Clippers in late October, and their second meeting is back at the Intuit Dome on Tuesday.

The Pistons remain undefeated in the Emirates NBA Cup, but their Cup win in Indiana on Friday was the only game in the last five for which they’ve had Cade Cunningham.
Three takeaways

Malik Beasley had a terrific game (25 points on 10-for-14 shooting) off the bench in Indiana, but the Pistons’ lineup with him in place of Cunningham has been outscored by 17 points in 52 total minutes this season, having allowed 124.5 points per 100 possessions. They scored just seven points on 10 possessions before making a sub in their loss in Philadelphia on Saturday, the second game this season in which they never held a lead.


Overall, that game was the Pistons’ worst offensive performance (96 points on 99 possessions) of the season. They’ve scored less than 110 points per 100 possessions in all four games without Cunningham.


The Pistons did get a win without Cunningham, beating the Raptors last Monday on Jaden Ivey’s floater at the buzzer. Ivey’s effective field goal percentage (52.0%) is still below the league average, but he’s seen a small jump for the second straight year. The improvement from last season is mostly about his shooting outside the paint: 42.4% from mid-range and 38.3% from beyond the arc, up from 37.9% and 33.6%.

They were a minus-45 from deep over the two weekend games against the Heat, even though they didn’t shoot that poorly (21-for-58, 36.2%), because Miami attempted 36 more 3-pointers over the 96 minutes. Toronto remains last in 3-point rate (35.1% of their total field goal attempts).


While they were outscored by 45 points from deep, the Raptors were a plus-48 in the paint (130-82) over the two games, with RJ Barrett (40), Jakob Poeltl (30) and Scottie Barnes (22) combining for 92 of the 130. Toronto has taken 56.1% of its shots in the paint, the highest rate for any team in the last three seasons.


The Raptors went on a 14-2 run late in the second quarter on Sunday, taking a five-point lead into the half. They lost that lead briefly, but are also the only team without a win (they’re 0-11) when they didn’t have a lead at halftime. Statistically, only the Pelicans have been (a hair) worse in the fourth quarter than Toronto (minus 11.7 points per 100 possessions).

The Raptors have won three straight at home, and their win over the Heat on Sunday was the start of their longest homestand of the season. It’ll be five or six games, depending on their two unscheduled games (which will be announced late Tuesday night).

Joel Embiid remains out, but Paul George returned on Saturday and the Sixers got a win in Detroit.
Three takeaways

Through their first eight games, the Sixers ranked 25th defensively. But over their last 10, they rank eighth (109.7 points allowed per 100 possessions). They’re defending the paint better while fouling less than they did those first few weeks.


The 76ers are continue to turn teams over, ranking second in opponent turnover rate this season. Tyrese Maxey is averaging 2 steals per 36 minutes (more than double his rate from the last three seasons). George’s 4.2 deflections per 36 would be his highest rate in the nine seasons for which deflections have been tracked.


Offense remains a struggle. Maxey had a pretty ridiculous game against the Rockets on Wednesday, but the Sixers still scored just 115 points on 112 possessions (103 per 100) as they lost in overtime (Maxey and Jared McCain combined to shoot 0-for-6 in the extra period). Only the Pelicans have seen a bigger drop in offensive efficiency from last season.

The Sixers are the only team with just a single two-game series (two straight games against the same opponent) on the schedule this season. Their only one is Wednesday and Friday, when they’ll host the Magic, who they lost to in Orlando 16 days ago. The Sixers are 0-12 (the Wizards are the only other winless team) against the 16 teams that are currently at or above .500.

The Hornets have lost five straight games and have lost LaMelo Ball (calf strain) for at least two weeks.
Three takeaways

The Hornets have allowed just 106.4 points per 100 possessions over the first four games of their five-game homestand. But they’ve scored just 100.5 per 100, sliding into the bottom-six in offensive efficiency for the season. Turnovers have been an issue: Ball had 14 (with his 14 assists) in the two games he played, while Brandon Miller has 17 turnovers (with 14 assists) over the four games total.


Four of the five games in this losing streak have been within five points in the last five minutes, but the Hornets have allowed 51 points on 34 clutch defensive possessions over those four close games. Cody Martin also went 0-for-2 from the line with the team down two in the final seconds against Miami, and then he missed an open corner 3 for the tie against the Knicks two nights later.


While registering the fourth-highest usage rate (38.5%) in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data, Ball has also had the most efficient scoring season of his career (true shooting percentage of 56.4%). The Hornets have scored just a point per possession in 356 total minutes with him off the floor.

The Hornets did get Nick Richards back from a 16-game absence on Saturday, so they’re a little healthier up front as they finish the five-game homestand with a visit from the Sixers on Tuesday. The first meeting (in Philadelphia last month) was won by the Sixers in overtime when Miller missed a pretty good look at a go-ahead 3.

Collin Sexton had Lakers’ Rui Hachimura beat for the go-ahead bucket in the closing seconds on Sunday … but Jazz coach Will Hardy called timeout just as Sexton was heading toward the basket. After the timeout, Sexton couldn’t get a shot off, and the Jazz have now lost eight of their last nine games.
Three takeaways

Lauri Markkanen and John Collins missed the Jazz’s loss to the Nuggets on Wednesday but were both back for their two games over the weekend. Utah’s current starting lineup — with Markkanen, Collins and Walker Kessler on the frontline — had a rough night against the Mavs on Saturday, but has still outscored opponents by 15.5 points per 100 possessions in 67 total minutes. The rebounding numbers have been pretty incredible, but some of that success also comes from the opponents shooting just 18-for-60 (30%) from 3-point range in those minutes.


The Jazz are still leaning on Keyonte George to run the offense, and the second-year guard has had at least five turnovers in four of the last five games, with a couple of costly ones down the stretch against the Lakers on Sunday. The Jazz have also allowed 123.8 points per 100 possessions with George on the floor, the worst on-court mark (by a healthy margin) among 268 players who’ve averaged at least 15 minutes per game.


Though he shot 1-for-8 against Dallas on Saturday, George has scored more efficiently over the last 10 games (true shooting percentage of 56.3%) than he did over the first 10 (45.8%).

The Jazz have played just three games (they’re 1-2) against the other 13 teams currently below .500, while every other team has played at least six games against the bottom 14. They’ll get two more games against that group this week, visiting the Blazers and Kings. They’ve lost their last four on the road, though they did have a nine-point, fourth-quarter lead in Sacramento before coming up short down the stretch in mid-November.

The Pelicans got both CJ McCollum and Dejounte Murray back from extended absences last week, but their losing streak has hit eight games, and they’re 2-17 since a 2-0 start.
Three takeaways

The Pelicans are still missing some talented players, with Herb Jones having missed the last 17 games, Zion Williamson having missed the last 12 and Brandon Ingram having missed the last four. They still don’t have a lineup that’s played more than 44 minutes together.


But even the talent that’s been playing hasn’t been playing well. McCollum and Murray combined for an effective field goal percentage of just 44.8% last week, and the Pelicans scored an anemic 90.4 points per 100 possessions in their 61 minutes on the floor together. Trey Murphy III has shot just 20-for-66 (30.3%) from 3-point range over his eight games.


The Pelicans are now 17.6 points per 100 possessions worse than they were last season. That would be the biggest season-to-season drop-off for any team since the Bulls were 18.2 per 100 worse in the season (1998-99) after the Last Dance.

Murray wasn’t available when the Pelicans lost to the Hawks a month ago, so he’ll face his former team for the first time in Atlanta on Monday. That’s one of two rest-disadvantage games for New Orleans this week.

The Wizards’ losing streak is at 14 games, and they now rank last on both ends of the floor.
Three takeaways

The Wizards’ best strategy for ending this losing streak would probably be to lean on their vets. Jonas Valančiūnas got his third start of the season in Milwaukee on Saturday and the Wizards outscored the Bucks by six points in his 21 minutes alongside Malcolm Brogdon, who scored a season-high 29 points. But they struggled, especially defensively, when both of those guys weren’t on the floor.


Valančiūnas was in the starting lineup in place of Kyle Kuzma, who suffered a rib sprain when the Wizards got clobbered by the Clippers on Wednesday. Brogdon, Kuzma and Valančiūnas have played just 16 total minutes together over the six games in which all three have been available.


The Wizards are the only team that’s never won an Emirates NBA Cup game, now 0-7 over two years of Cup play after their loss to the Bulls last week. That was the third time during this losing streak that they had a double-digit lead, but they were outscored by 22 points in the second quarter. They’ve lost the third period in all 14 games during the streak.

The Wizards’ last chance to get an Emirates NBA Cup win this season is Tuesday in Cleveland, when they’ll likely be without Kuzma again. They’ll have a chance to end their 21-game losing streak in the second games of back-to-backs when they host the Grizzlies (who will also have played the night before) on Sunday.

The Cavs suffered their fourth loss of the season in Miami on Sunday. More important is that they suffered the first injury to their top four players, with Evan Mobley turning his left ankle in the first half.
Three takeaways

The injury came a little more than 24 hours after Mobley scored a career-high 41 points in Charlotte. He shot 6-for-8 from 3-point range but also scored 20 points in the paint for the third time this season. While his 22 3-pointers for the season are tied for his total over each of the previous two years (and one shy of his career-high 23 as a rookie), he’s also seen a jump in free throw rate.


The Cavs will play just twice over the next 11 days, with those two games against the Wizards and Nets, so there’s no better time for one of their best players to have turned an ankle. They’ve now played just 45 total minutes (getting outscored by 4 points) with Darius Garland, Donovan Mitchell and Jarrett Allen on the floor without Mobley. More important when they lose one is that they can’t have a star guard and a rim protector on the floor at all times. Their 260 Mitchell-Mobley minutes without Garland or Allen have been much better (plus-12.6 points per 100 possessions) than their 254 Garland-Allen minutes without Mitchell or Mobley (minus-0.5 per 100).


When the Cavs have lost, it’s been more about defense (123.2 points allowed per 100 possessions in the four losses) than offense (113.5 scored per 100). And it’s been mostly about how well their opponents have shot from 3-point range (35.1% in wins vs. 46.8% in losses). According to Second Spectrum tracking, 51% of their opponents’ 3-point attempts have been wide open, a rate that’s right at the league average.

The Cavs will have more multi-day breaks (three) in the next 11 days than they’ve had thus far (two). They’ve won their two games against the Wizards by a total of 50 points and will host the league’s worst team again on Friday.

The Celtics got a good win over the surging Bucks on Friday but suffered their third home loss of the season the following night against Memphis. (They won their first 20 home games last season, not losing at TD Garden until Jan. 19.)
Three takeaways

No matter how often you watch them, it’s still jarring how unabashedly the Celtics are launching 3-pointers this season, whether they be contested, early in the clock, off the dribble or whatever. The win over Milwaukee was the eighth time they’ve taken at least 60% of their shots from beyond the arc, having never done it last season (including playoffs) and with every other team having done it just once this season (the Bulls on Sunday).


The Pistons shot 20-for-39 (51%) from 3-point range on Wednesday and the Celtics (21-for-53) still outscored them from beyond the arc. The loss to Memphis came with Boston shooting 18-for-60 (30%) from deep, with Jrue Holiday being dared into a 4-for-17 performance. But the Celtics still have the league’s best record (8-4) in games in which they shot worse than the league average (36.0%) from 3-point range.


The Celtics have also been able to win games while still giving guys days off. Five of their top eight guys missed at least one of their four games last week and they’ve still had all eight available just once (at Chicago 10 days ago). Their when-healthy starting lineup (with Kristaps Porziņģis) has played in just three games together but is still their second-most-used lineup of the season.

The Celtics, 10-1 against the 13 teams currently at or below .500, will play the Pistons and Wizards this week.

The Thunder remain at the top of the Western Conference, now three games in the loss column ahead of the Grizzlies, Rockets and Mavs.
Three takeaways

The Thunder continue to force turnovers at an incredible rate, with Utah’s 29 turnovers (18 of them live balls) on Tuesday tied for the most for any team in a game in more than three years. Last season, they led the league with 12 games of forcing at least 20 turnovers, and they have 10 already this season.


Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has seen a big jump in 3-point rate from last season, but after a 1-for-10 performance in Toronto on Thursday, has shot just 32.6% from beyond the arc. He’s shot a career-best 62.5% in the paint though, leading the league in drives per game (21.5) for the fifth straight season.


Last season, the Thunder led the league in both the percentage of their 3-point attempts that were off the catch (80%) and the percentage that were wide open (66%), according to Second Spectrum tracking. They’ve seen big drops in both rates (to 69% and 60%), but the latter mark (wide-open) still ranks third.

When the Thunder lost to the Mavs (without Luka Dončić) a few weeks ago, it was during the five-game stretch when they didn’t have Chet Holmgren or Isaiah Hartenstein, and they got destroyed on the glass. They’ll have an opportunity to avenge that loss and earn a trip to Las Vegas on Tuesday.

The Mavs have won seven straight (despite a crazy travel schedule) and 11 of their last 12, with the only loss having come in overtime (and on the road).
Three takeaways

The Mavs’ deadline trades last season have affected their defense. But they also changed the team’s shot profile, with Dallas taking 46% of its shots in the paint after acquiring Daniel Gafford and P.J. Washington, up from 42% (the league’s lowest rate) prior. This season, the Mavs have taken 50% of their shots (eighth highest rate) in the paint, with that being the league’s biggest jump from last season (43% overall) by a huge margin.


With more shots in the paint, you can also get more free throws. Over their four December games, the Mavs have attempted 72 more free throws than their opponents. That includes the league’s biggest differential (44-14) of the season in their win over the Grizzlies on Tuesday.


Dereck Lively II has now started the last 12 games he’s played in and, even though he’s now playing against other starters, the defense has still been much better with him on the floor (100.0 points allowed per 100 possessions) than it’s been with him off the floor (112.9 per 100) over that stretch.

Since the 2024 Western Conference semifinals, the Mavs have won five of their last six games against the Thunder. But they were without Luka Dončić and the Thunder were without Isaiah Hartenstein when Dallas won in Oklahoma City last month. So it should be a very different game when they meet in the Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals on Tuesday.

The Grizzlies have won nine of their last ten games, getting a signature win (with a signature dunk) in Boston on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies are the only team that ranks in the top seven on both ends of the floor. It’s not a surprise to see them there on defense, but the offense, especially the shooting, is something new. The Grizzlies haven’t ranked higher than 20th in effective field goal percentage in the last 10 seasons, even when they had the league’s fourth-ranked offense (thanks to lots of rebounds and few turnovers) three seasons ago.


Of course, the shooting is strongest in the paint. The Grizzlies are the only team that ranks in the top five in both field goal percentage in the paint (59.6%, fourth) and the percentage of their shots that have come in the paint (54%, fourth). Brandon Clarke (69.0%) and Santi Aldama (66.4%) rank seventh and 13th in field goal percentage in the paint among 113 players with at least 100 attempts.


The Grizzlies rank ninth in free throw rate, but they attempted 30 fewer free throws than the Mavs (44-14) in their loss on Tuesday, with that being the biggest discrepancy in any game this season. Part of that discrepancy was a coach’s challenge that backfired (turning into two shots for Dereck Lively II) and a silly Marcus Smart foul 94 feet from the basket, both on the 13-0 Dallas run that turned an eight-point lead (with 3:15 left) into a five-point defeat.

The Grizzlies got one of the two interconference games this week, and it’s against the only team (Brooklyn) that’s beaten them twice this season. They were outscored by 36 points from 3-point range over the two losses, shooting less than 30% from beyond the arc in both.

The Warriors ended their five-game losing streak by beating the Rockets without Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. The stars returned over the weekend, but the Warriors needed a big second half to earn a split of their two-game series with the Wolves.
Three takeaways

After scoring 118.4 points per 100 possessions (fourth in the league) over their first 12 games (including three without Curry), the Warriors have scored just 105.8 (28th) over their last 11. Jonathan Kuminga has the fifth-worst true shooting percentage (49.1%) among 96 players with at least 100 field goal attempts over that stretch, and his season-long mark (51.6%) is way down from 59.8% over his first three seasons in the league.


Kuminga did score 33 of the Warriors’ 99 points in their ugly win over the Rockets on Thursday. He’s the Warriors’ new starting power forward, apparently, starting ahead of Green (who made his return) the following night against Minnesota. Of course, Steve Kerr reshuffled his lineup on Sunday (with Andrew Wiggins out), starting Green alongside Kuminga. The Warriors are one of six teams that don’t have a lineup that’s played at least 75 minutes together.


All five games on the losing streak were within five points in the last five minutes, with the Warriors scoring just 10 points on 26 clutch possessions. The clutch offense wasn’t much better the last four days, but Kuminga was 3-for-3 on clutch shots against Houston, and they held the Wolves to just three points on seven clutch possessions on Sunday.

No matter who they play in the NBA Cup semis or the game between the quarterfinals losers in the West (Dallas or Oklahoma City), the Warriors are three games into a stretch where they’re playing seven straight against teams that currently rank in the top eight defensively. They’ve won both their meetings with the Rockets thus far, with the two teams combining to score less than 108 points per 100 possessions over 101 minutes.

The Rockets lost two straight games for the first time but salvaged their three-game trip through California with a win over the Clippers on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Their loss in Sacramento on Tuesday was the Rockets’ worst defensive game of the season, while their loss at Golden State two nights later was their worst offensive performance. One common issue was that they were outscored in the paint by double-digits both nights. The Rockets were outscored in the paint just three times in their first 18 games, but have been outscored in the paint in each of their last six (by an average of 13 points).


The Rockets have outscored their opponents in the first, third and fourth quarters this season. But closing the second quarter was a problem against the Kings (11-1 run to close the half) and Warriors (9-1 run to close the half). Then the Rockets went on their own, 12-0 run to close the half against the Clips, with Jalen Green scoring the first seven of those 12 points.


The Rockets were without Fred VanVleet on Sunday, with Amen Thompson taking his place in the starting lineup. The Rockets have allowed just 84.6 points per 100 possessions in 181 total minutes with Thompson, Dillon Brooks and Alperen Sengun all on the floor. That’s the best on-court defensive mark among 856 three-man combos that have played a least 100 minutes together.

After losing to the Warriors without Stephen Curry and Draymond Green last week, the Rockets will likely see them both on Wednesday, when a trip to Las Vegas will be on the line. The Warriors have attempted 47 free throws per 100 shots from the field in the two meetings thus far, with that being their highest rate vs. any opponent and the highest rate for any team vs. the Rockets.

The Knicks got a big win over the Magic to reach the Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals for the second straight season, but their second four-game winning streak of the season came to an end with a loss (without Karl-Anthony Towns) to the Pistons on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Knicks have climbed out of the bottom 10 on defense, with the winning streak (101.6 points allowed per 100 possessions) being their best stretch on that end of the floor by a wide margin. Of course, all four games (plus their loss to the Pistons) were against teams that rank in the bottom 10 on offense, and much of the improvement was about how poorly those opponents shot from the perimeter.


While they’ve seen a huge drop in offensive rebounding percentage, the Knicks remain strong (fifth) on the defensive glass. Towns has grabbed 31% of available defensive boards when he’s been on the floor, the second-highest rate among 329 players who’ve averaged at least 10 minutes per game and the highest rate of his career by a huge margin. His previous high (27.2%) was in the last full season (2017-18) that Tom Thibodeau was Towns’ coach in Minnesota.


Despite the loss to the Pistons over the weekend, the Knicks have been 11.3 points per 100 possessions better at home (plus-12.9, second best) than they’ve been on the road (plus-1.6, 10th). That’s the league’s third biggest home-road differential, with the much bigger difference on the defensive end of the floor.

This year, the Knicks will be at home for the Cup quarterfinals (they lost in Milwaukee in 2023), having lost to the Hawks in Atlanta in early November. They allowed 121 points on just 99 possessions in that game, with the Hawks’ 27 second-chance points being eight more than the Knicks have allowed in any other game this season.

An oblique injury to Paolo Banchero had turned Franz Wagner into a sure-fire All-Star … until Wagner suffered an oblique injury himself on Friday. Now the Magic have to survive without both of them.
Three takeaways

Maybe it’s just Jalen Suggs’ turn. The fourth-year guard scored 26 points in a little more than 31 minutes as the Magic beat the Suns in their first game without Banchero or Wagner on Sunday. They did score more efficiently with Suggs on the bench and have still scored an anemic 95 points per 100 possessions in his 198 total minutes on the floor without Wagner or Banchero.


The win over the Suns came at the Kia Center, improving the Magic to 10-0 (the only undefeated team) at home. They’ve played the league’s most road-heavy schedule thus far and the bigger difference between the Home Magic (116.8 points scored per 100 possessions) and the Away Magic (106.5) has been on offense. Weirdly, the Magic players with the biggest home-road splits regarding field goal percentage are centers Goga Bitadze (73% vs. 60%) and Mo Wagner (61% vs. 50%).


After shooting 18-for-35 (51%) from 3-point range in the first game of their recent five-game trip, the Magic shot 26% from deep over the last four, and they weren’t much better (12-for-36, 33%) at home on Sunday. They’re only a tick behind the 29th-ranked Wizards, but their season-long 31.1% from 3-point range would be the worst mark for any team in the last 12 seasons.

Magic-Bucks is the only one of the four Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinal matchups that we haven’t yet seen this season. The home team won all four games between Milwaukee and Orlando last season, with the bigger difference between the wins and losses coming on Milwaukee’s end of the floor.

The Clippers might be coming back to the Play-In pack in the Western Conference, having lost their last two games.
Three takeaways

The Clippers may have run out of gas when they played the Wolves (without Norman Powell) on Wednesday, after which they were tied for the league lead with 24 total games played. They were 3-1 in the second games of back-to-backs to start the season, but have lost the last two by 32 and 28 points. Their three days off before their loss to the Rockets on Sunday was their first multi-day break since before Halloween.


Terance Mann is out a few weeks with a fractured finger suffered in the Clippers’ win over Portland on Tuesday. After starting the first 11 games of the season, Mann had come off the bench for the next 12. He had shot much better (effective field goal percentage of 56.9%) as a reserve than he did as a starter (41.1%) and the Clippers’ starting lineup (with Kris Dunn in Mann’s place) has outscored opponents by 16.4 points per 100 possessions in 110 total minutes.


Alas, that lineup didn’t play together in either of the last two games, with Powell missing the loss to Minnesota and James Harden out (for the first time this season) against Houston on Sunday. That was the Clippers’ only game between last Wednesday and this coming Friday, so just one game missed turned three days of rest into eight.

With the new schedule, the Clippers are playing three of their four games against the Nuggets in Denver, where they won in Week 1 behind 37 points from Powell. They’re back at Ball Arena on Friday.

The Heat have won three straight games for the first time. It’s also the first time they’re two games over .500, which is good for fifth place in the Eastern Conference.
Three takeaways

The first two wins came against teams — the Lakers and Suns — going through some struggles, but the Heat handed the Cavs just their fourth loss of the season on Sunday. The streak has mostly been about offense, with Miami scoring a pretty incredible 130 points per 100 possessions over the three games and climbing into the top 10 on that end of the floor.


Tyler Herro has been the offensive star, averaging 27.3 points (on an effective field goal percentage of 73%) and six assists over the three games. For the season, Herro is registering career-best marks in 2-point percentage (54.8%), 3-point percentage (42.2%) and free throw rate (22.4 attempts per 100 shots from the field). His true shooting percentage of 63.2% ranks eighth among 43 players who’ve averaged at least 20 points per game.


The Heat have been at their worst in the first quarter, but their starting lineup for nine of the last 10 games — with Duncan Robinson and Haywood Highsmith — has outscored opponents by 20.7 points per 100 possessions in 116 total minutes over that stretch.

After four straight games against teams with winning records, the Heat get a pair of below-.500 squads — Toronto and Detroit — with their newly scheduled games for the next eight days. They’re 7-4 against the 12 teams that currently have losing records.

A four-game winning streak had the Wolves climbing the Western Conference standings, but it came to an end with a second-half collapse at Golden State on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Wolves seemingly found last season’s defense, allowing an incredible 87.7 points per 100 possessions over the winning streak, down from 113.0 per 100 over their previous nine games (2-7). Even with the loss on Sunday, they’re back in the top five on that end of the floor.


The strong defense continued through the first half on Sunday, when the Wolves were up nine at the break, holding a 9-0 record (one of two undefeated teams) when leading at the half. But they allowed the Warriors to score 44 points on 25 possessions in the third quarter, with 24 of those points coming in the paint or at the free throw line. The loss leaves Denver (5-0) as the only undefeated team when leading at the half.


Even with that third quarter, their opponents’ effective field goal percentage has seen a bigger drop in the paint (49.2% over the last five games vs. 57.7% prior) than it has from the outside.

The second win in the winning streak was at home against the Lakers last Monday, with L.A. shooting just 6-for-31 from 3-point range. They’ll meet again at the Target Center on Friday.

It’s tough when a guy tallies 104 points, 30 rebounds and 16 assists over a back-to-back, and his team splits the two games. It’s even tougher when the loss comes to a team that had lost 16 straight.
Three takeaways

Nikola Jokić’s career-high 56 points in Washington on Saturday didn’t come particularly efficiently, at least by his own standards. He recorded the highest usage rate (46.6%) of his career (774 games, including playoffs) and accounted for 74 of the 102 points the Nuggets scored (via points and assists) in his 39 minutes on the floor.


Amazingly, the loss (to the team that ranks last defensively by a healthy margin) was also the sixth-worst offensive game of the season for the Nuggets, who are 0-6 when they’ve scored fewer than 108 points per 100 possessions. They’re also now 0-3 all-time when Jokić has scored 50 points or more, so he wisely scored only 48 in Atlanta on Sunday. (Both games came without Jamal Murray, it should be noted.)


One of Jokić’s best traits is his touch, which was on display on the game-tying bucket against the Warriors on Tuesday. After turning Stephen Curry around with a fake pass, his 18-foot jumper just died on the rim before rolling through the net. His 52.4% on 2-point shots outside the restricted area is his worst mark in the last six seasons, but still ranks sixth among 79 players with at least 75 attempts.

When the Nuggets host the Clippers on Friday, it will have been more than a month since they won two straight games. They lost to the Clippers (in L.A.) eight days ago, despite a triple-double from Jokic.

The Hawks won six straight games, beating the Cavs twice and ending the Bucks’ seven-game winning streak along the way. But they ran into Nikola Jokić on Sunday, and the loss to the Nuggets dropped them back into seventh place in the improving Eastern Conference.
Three takeaways

Trae Young has shot just 31% from 3-point range this season, including just 20-for-82 (24%) over his last 11 games. But he drained the overtime game-winner against the Lakers on Friday, the Hawks’ fourth straight win (they’re 8-5) in games that were within five points in the last five minutes. Young leads the league in both clutch assists (17) and total clutch free throws, which have accounted for 25 of his 45 clutch points.


The loss to the Nuggets came without both Jalen Johnson (shoulder issue) and Bogdan Bogdanović (quad contusion). The Hawks had some good bench minutes earlier in the week, but overall, have been 13.7 points per 100 possessions better with Johnson on the floor (plus-1.2) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-12.5).


Young’s game-winning 3-pointer gave the Hawks one more 3 than the Lakers, making that just the fifth game this season in which Atlanta has outscored its opponent from beyond the arc. With Denver (not a high-volume 3-point team whatsoever) outscoring the Hawks from deep on Sunday, the Hawks have the worst 3-point discrepancy (-11 points per game) for any team in the last two seasons.

The Hawks were outscored by 21 points from beyond the arc when they beat the Knicks by five early last month. They’ll make their first trip to Madison Square Garden for the Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals on Wednesday.

Khris Middleton made his season debut last week, and he hit a pair of big shots as the Bucks got a much-needed win in Brooklyn on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The huge difference between the Bucks’ two wins and their two losses last week was on the offensive end of the floor, with the win in Brooklyn being their most efficient game (118 points on just 91 possessions) of the season. They’re now 11-5 when they’ve shot the league average (36.0%) or better from 3-point range and 1-6 when they haven’t, with that being the league’s fourth biggest differential.


Giannis Antetokounmpo has had 11 games with zero 3-point attempts, with his season-long 3-point rate (3.4%) the lowest of his career and down from 9.1% last season. But with the Bucks down one and about a minute and a half left in Boston on Friday, Antetokounmpo pulled up in transition and launched a 3 that was off the mark. The Bucks didn’t get another chance to take the lead and Antetokounmpo is now 3-for-15 from beyond the arc for the season. Only Charles Barkley (26.6% on 2,020 attempts) has shot worse on as many career 3-point attempts as Antetokounmpo (28.5% on 1,860).


Middleton shot just 5-for-18 in his first two games back but was 10-for-10 from the line. He hit two clutch jumpers on the game-deciding 12-2 run in Brooklyn on Sunday and had 11 assists in 43 total minutes.

The Bucks and Knicks are the only teams to reach the Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals both years, and Milwaukee is the only team to host both times. They clobbered New York in the quarters a year ago and will get the shorthanded Magic at Fiserv Forum on Tuesday.

Kevin Durant was only back for 3 1/2 games before suffering an ankle sprain against the Spurs on Tuesday. The Suns are 1-9 (with eight straight losses) without their biggest star.
Three takeaways

The much bigger difference between the Suns’ games with Durant (109.2 points allowed per 100 possessions) and their games without him (121.2 allowed per 100) continues to be on defense. Their loss in New Orleans on Thursday put an end to the Pelicans’ nine-game losing streak and was the first time in almost a month that the Pels had scored more than 120 points per 100 possessions. Two nights later, they allowed the Heat to score 121 points on just 95 possessions, their second most efficient-performance of the season. And on Sunday, the Magic scored more efficiently than their season-long mark even though they were without Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner.


The difference is almost all about how effectively their opponents have shot. And the bigger difference is in the paint: 53.6% in games Durant has played vs. 63.0% in games he’s missed.


Devin Booker’s scoring has been only slightly higher, while his efficiency has been down in the games Durant has missed (25.2 points per game, true shooting percentage of 56.1%) vs. the games Durant has played (24.6, 59.5%). Bradley Beal has seen a much bigger jump in production while scoring slightly more efficiently: 21.8 points per game on 59.8% vs. just 15.8 on 59.2% in the games Durant has missed.

The only win without Durant came (by eight points) in Utah, where the Suns will travel for a second visit on Friday. Their next four games are against those that currently have losing records.

The Kings have won two straight games for the first time in more than a month, clobbering the Spurs and Jazz over the weekend.
Three takeaways

After coming off the bench in his first 169 games with the Kings, Malik Monk has started the last five. The offense has been efficient on both ends of the floor in the 97 minutes that the new lineup (though it’s long been the Kings’ closing lineup) has been on the floor together over the five games, with the Kings’ lineup and their opponents combining to score 122 points per 100 possessions.


That lineup somehow got outscored by four points over the two weekend wins, so bench minutes were critical. After a rough game off the bench on Thursday, Kevin Huerter totaled 42 points on 16-for-21 shooting in the two games. The Kings have the league’s fourth-ranked bench over the two weeks that Huerter has been a reserve.


The two weekend wins were the Kings’ two most efficient offensive performances of the season and came with their two largest margins of victory.

The Kings’ first newly scheduled game is an opportunity to exorcise some demons. They were 0-6 against the Pelicans last season and their first meeting in ’24-25 is a visit to New Orleans on Thursday. That’s the second game in a stretch where they’re playing six of eight against teams that rank no higher than 24th defensively.

The Sixers have won four of their last five games, with Joel Embiid returning from a seven-game absence on Sunday afternoon.
Three takeaways

Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey played more than four times as many minutes together in Chicago on Sunday (26.2) as they had through the Sixers’ first 21 games (6.1). They outscored the Bulls by 14 points in those 26 minutes, holding Chicago to just 41 points on 57 possessions (0.72 per).


Overall, the 4-1 stretch has been the Sixers’ best stretch of defense (104.2 points allowed per 100 possessions) this season, with three of the five opponents scoring less than a point per possession. The first four games came against teams — Detroit, Charlotte and Orlando (x 2) — that rank in the bottom 10 offensively, but Chicago ranked ninth on that end of the floor before Sunday. George has been a big part of that defensive improvement and wasn’t available for the Sixers’ loss to the Magic on Wednesday, so they’ve won the last four games he’s played.


Embiid scored 31 points in a little less than 33 minutes in his return, with 10 of his 13 buckets being assisted by Tyrese Maxey, who recorded his first career triple-double. Embiid shot 3-for-14 from outside the paint but took just as many shots (10-for-14) in the paint. Only 22 (38%) of his 58 shots through his first four games came in the paint.

Despite the 3-14 start, the Sixers are tied in the loss column with two of the current SoFi Play-In Tournament teams in the East. One of those two is the Pacers (10-15), who the Sixers will host after four days off. One of their two wins without George came (in overtime) in Indiana in October.

LeBron James missed a game for the first time on Sunday, but the Lakers put an end to their three-game losing streak with a big fourth quarter against Portland.
Three takeaways

The win was, statistically, the Lakers’ best defensive game of the season, holding the Blazers to 98 points on 97 possessions. They remain one of three teams — the Pelicans and Wizards are the others — that have yet to hold an opponent under a point per possession. Overall, only New Orleans has seen a bigger jump in points allowed per 100 from last season than the Lakers (+2.2).


L.A. also ranks in the bottom five in clutch defense. James and Anthony Davis responded after their embarrassing loss in Miami, combining for 77 points, 20 rebounds and 19 assists in Atlanta on Friday. But the Lakers still lost in overtime, losing Trae Young after he gave up the ball and allowing him to get an open look at the game-winning 3-pointer.


Never before had James’ team been better with him off the floor and he’s had on-off differentials in the double-digits in 11 of the 17 seasons for which we have on-off data. But the Lakers have now been 12.5 points per 100 possessions better with him off the floor (plus-4.1) than they’ve been with him on the floor (minus-8.4), with the bigger difference on defense.

Having lost by 29 in Minnesota last week, the Lakers are back at the Target Center on Friday. They’re 3-6 in games played between the 10 West teams that currently have winning records, having split two meetings with each of the two teams they’ll face this week.

After a three-game losing streak dropped them below .500, the Spurs got Victor Wembanyama back from a two-game absence and got a rest-advantage win over the Pelicans on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Spurs have now gone 10 games without winning the first quarter, getting outscored by 34.1 points per 100 possessions over those 120 total first-quarter minutes. They were up 13 with 2:30 left in the first period against the Kings on Friday, but that lead was gone by the end of the quarter and they were eventually in a 12-point hole midway through the second.


The Spurs allowed just 107.8 points per 100 possessions over Victor Wembanyama’s first (three-game) absence, but they allowed the Bulls and Kings to score 133.5 per 100 without him last week. Overall, they’ve allowed 8.3 fewer points per 100 possessions with Wembanyama on the floor (108.2) than they have with him off the floor (116.5), a bigger differential than they had last season (6.1 per 100).


With an inbounds pass to Wembanyama midway through the second quarter on Sunday, Chris Paul passed Jason Kidd for second in career assists. Paul’s assist/turnover ratio of 4.77 would be the second highest of his career and while the Spurs’ defense needs the 20-year-old phenom, the offense needs the 39-year-old vet. San Antonio has scored 10 more points per 100 possessions with Paul on the floor (114) than it has with him off the floor (104).

With those big on-off differentials, the Spurs’ bench ranks 25th this season. But the bench had some good minutes (without Tre Jones or Devin Vassell) in their first meeting (a 13-point win) against the Blazers. They’re in Portland for meeting No. 2 on Friday.

The Bulls began December with a pair of double-digit wins, but when they came home and got healthier (Coby White back), they dropped two games to close neighbors — the Pacers and Sixers — in the Eastern Conference standings.
Three takeaways

Their game against the Pacers on Friday was just the fifth time this season that the Bulls had more shooting opportunities than their opponent. And they did pretty well with their shooting opportunities, going 21-for-50 (42%) from 3-point range. But the Pacers shot much more effectively on the other end of the floor and had their third most efficient-game of the season. Only the Pelicans and Lakers have seen bigger jumps in points allowed per 100 possessions from last season than the Bulls (+1.7).


Where they’ve seen the biggest drop-off goes back to that shooting-opportunity discrepancy. The Bulls have forced just 11.8 turnovers per 100 possessions, the league’s lowest opponent rate and down from 14.2 per 100 (eighth highest) last season. The big season-to-season jump in pace somehow has their opponents taking much better care of the ball.


The Bulls are the only team with a winning record on the road (7-6) and a losing record at home (3-9). Statistically, the bigger difference has been on offense, with Coby White one guy who’s shot much better on the road.

The Bulls have two games left on a stretch of six straight against teams that are currently at or below .500. Friday brings their first meeting with the Hornets, also the end of a three-game homestand (their first homestand of more than two games).

The Nets put an end to a three-game losing streak with an ugly win over the Pacers last week, but couldn’t hold on against Milwaukee on Sunday afternoon.
Three takeaways

Dorian Finney-Smith has had the best shooting season of his career (effective field goal percentage of 61.2%), and the Nets offense has been at its best (119 points scored per 100 possessions) with him on the floor. They scored less than a point per possession as he missed four games (also Games 2-5 of Cam Thomas’ absence), but broke out offensively (113 on 92) with Finney-Smith making his return against the Bucks on Sunday.


Alas, that wasn’t enough, as the Bucks scored 118 on 91, including 20 points on 12 clutch possessions. The Nets are one of two teams — the Wizards are the other — that rank in the bottom five in three of the four factors on defense, 30th in opponent effective field goal percentage, 30th in opponent free throw rate, and 26th in defensive rebounding percentage.


The rebounding could see improvement with more minutes for Day’Ron Sharpe, who made his season debut last week and played 44 total minutes over three games. The fourth-year big ranked third in total rebounding percentage (19.9%) among 288 players who averaged at least 15 minutes per game last season.

Just 1-4 since they came back East, the Nets are still 6-1 against the Western Conference, and they got one of the two extra interconference games this season.

The Pistons have shot 38-for-75 (51%) from 3-point range over their last two games but only got one win out of the two because 20 3-pointers in Boston wasn’t enough on Wednesday. The Celtics got 13 more shooting opportunities than the Pistons, who continue to have the league’s third-worst turnover differential (+2.9 per game).


Malik Beasley was 13-for-21 (62%) from beyond the arc over the two games, including 6-for-6 from the corners. He was the league leader (by a wide margin) with 105 corner 3s last season and is one behind Mikal Bridges (33) for the league lead this season.

The Raptors are 2-2 on the five-game homestand (their longest of the season) that ends Monday, 2-0 against the East and 0-2 against the West.
Three takeaways

Scottie Barnes had games of 35 points (in a win over Indiana) and 14 assists (in a loss to Dallas) last week. The absence of Immanuel Quickley has had an effect, but Barnes has been much more of a ball-handler this season, with Toronto setting twice as many ball screens for him per 100 possessions (33.2) as they did last season (16.6), according to Second Spectrum tracking.


Since Barnes’ return nine games ago, the Raptors have been 16 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (plus-2.6 per 100) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-13.4 per 100). That latter number includes getting outscored by 17.4 per 100 in 89 minutes with RJ Barrett on the floor without Barnes.


Kelly Olynyk could give the bench a little lift, having made his season debut on Saturday, shooting a perfect 3-for-3 from the field (all 3-point attempts) and 4-for-4 from the line. He could certainly reduce their 3-point discrepancy, now at 6.8 points per game (seventh-worst).

The last time the Knicks played in Toronto (March 27), they had the second most efficient offensive performance (145 points on 93 possessions) for any team in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data. They’re back on Monday.

The Pacers put an end to two losing streaks over the weekend. Their win in Chicago on Friday ended their own, four-game streak (and an eight-game losing streak on the road), and their loss to Charlotte on Sunday ended the Hornets’ eight-game streak.
Three takeaways

Their win in Chicago on Friday didn’t just end an eight-game road losing streak. It was also the Pacers’ first win that wasn’t within five points in the last five minutes. It was, seemingly an offensive breakthrough (132 points on 104 possessions), but the offense struggled again as they lost to the Hornets two nights later.


The Pacers’ loss in Brooklyn on Wednesday was the only time this season that the Nets have held their opponent under a point per possession. The Pacers have still seen the league’s third-biggest drop in offensive efficiency from last season. Their shooting is much worse (with Tyrese Haliburton and Andrew Nembhard seeing significant drops in effective field goal percentage), but they’ve also seen fewer second chances. They rank 28th in offensive rebounding percentage (24.5%), down from 16th (28.4%) last season.


The ball and player movement is still there. The Pacers rank in the top five in both, having seen increases in both vs. last season. But they’ve now been without Aaron Nesmith for the last 19 games. Even at the time he got hurt (through six games), the offense was much better with Nesmith on the floor.

The Pacers have two games left on a stretch of six straight against teams that currently have losing records, just 5-8 in games played within that group after the weekend split.

The Hornets put an end to an eight-game losing streak and got their first win without LaMelo Ball, holding on to beat the Pacers on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Brandon Miller has a usage rate of 32.2% (seventh in the league) over Ball’s six-game absence, up from 25.8% prior. He hasn’t been shooting as effectively but has almost as many free throw attempts over the six games (30) as he had over his first 14 (31). And because he’s a 90% shooter at the line, his overall efficiency has taken only a small dip.


Mark Williams (returning from a left foot injury) made his season debut last week and played 30 total minutes over three games. The Hornets allowed 87 points on just 57 possessions (153 per 100) in those 30 minutes, but Williams looked terrific (12 points, five rebounds, two assists) in less than 11 first-half minutes against the Cavs on Saturday.


The Hornets are obviously being very cautious with Williams’ ramp-up. He didn’t play at all in the second half against Cleveland and wasn’t in uniform the following night against Indiana. With Moussa Diabaté missing both games, the Hornets played quite a bit of small ball over the weekend, getting outscored by seven points in a little less than 36 total minutes with no center on the floor.

Their win in Indiana on Sunday began a stretch of five straight games against teams with losing records. The Hornets are 5-3 within that group thus far.

All three games on the Jazz’s three-game trip last week were decided by 27 points or more, and they won one of the three.
Three takeaways

The Jazz have the highest turnover (18.4 per 100 possessions) rate for any team in the last 18 seasons. The Thunder have the highest opponent rate (19.1 per 100) in the last 26 seasons. Put them together and you have Utah committing 29 turnovers in Oklahoma City on Tuesday, tied for the most for any team in a game in more than three years. Five Jazz players had four or five turnovers, and Utah has still committed fewer turnovers than the opponent in just one of its 23 games.


They did have only 14 turnovers in their 42-point win in Portland (without Lauri Markkanen) on Friday. It was both the Jazz’s best offensive game of the season (141 points on 105 possessions) and the first time they’ve allowed less than a point per possession.


Walker Kessler had five blocks in the win over Portland. His rim protection numbers (opponents have shot 54.4% at the rim when he’s been there) aren’t as good as they were over his first two seasons (51.2%), but the Jazz have still outscored their opponents with Kessler, Markkanen and John Collins on the floor together (even though they got clobbered with all three in uniform on Sunday).

The Jazz’s lone home game in a stretch where they’re playing eight of nine on the road is Friday against the Suns. Bench minutes were an issue when the Jazz lost the first meeting (also at home) last month.

Things are getting ugly again for the Blazers, who’ve dropped four straight games, with a 42-point loss to the Jazz included.
Three takeaways

The Blazers ranked 17th defensively through Nov. 30, a nice improvement for a team that ranked 23rd on that end of the floor last season and no higher than 27th in the four seasons before that. But they allowed an amazing 135 points per 100 possessions in their first three games this month to fall back into the bottom 10. And it’s not like they were facing three great offenses; Two of the three opponents — the Clippers and Jazz — rank in the bottom 10 offensively.


Over the last five seasons (since 2020-21), the Blazers have now lost 10 games by at least 40 points, with no other team having more than four losses by 40-plus over that stretch. This season’s Blazers are now 8-16 with the point differential (minus-9.6 per game, third worst) of a team that’s 5-19.


Anfernee Simons had a solid stretch of three games ending with 27 points on 8-for-11 shooting against Dallas eight days ago. But he’s shot just 13-for-39 (including 3-for-19 from 3-point range) over the last three. Simons has seen a drop in usage rate, but also a big drop in efficiency from last season.

With an added game at the Moda Center on Friday, the Blazers will play the Spurs twice in the next two weeks. The Blazers were outscored by 21 points from 3-point range in the first meeting (a 13-point loss in San Antonio).

The hits just keep on coming. The Pelicans got Herb Jones and Brandon Ingram back from 18 and five-game absences respectively last week, only for Ingram to suffer a serious ankle sprain in his second game back. The Pelicans did manage to end their losing streak, beating the Suns with Jones smothering Devin Booker on the final possession, before losing Ingram again.
Three takeaways

Over the 1 1/2 games they had them all last week, the Pelicans played 12 minutes with their five best available players — Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum, Jones, Ingram and Trey Murphy III – on the floor together, scoring 32 points on 25 offensive possessions. The win on Thursday was their best offensive game (126 on 103) in almost a month.


Over his three games back, the Pelicans have allowed 112.3 points per 100 possessions in Jones’ 106 minutes on the floor and 128.6 in his 38 minutes on the bench. Jones’ 4.6 deflections per 36 minutes rank 10th among 307 players who’ve played at least 200 minutes, nine spots behind the guy — Dyson Daniels — the Pelicans traded for Murray.


McCollum and Murray continue to shoot pretty ineffectively, but Murphy has seen an uptick, registering an effective field goal percentage of 69% over the last three games. He got a decent 3-point look for the tie in the closing seconds in San Antonio on Sunday, but his shot was off the mark.

The Pelicans went 6-0 (with an average point differential of 17.2 points) against Sacramento last season, so they’re probably happy to welcome the Kings to New Orleans for one of their newly-scheduled games on Thursday.

It’s always darkest before the dawn. The Wizards’ losing streak hit 16 games with their two worst defeats of the season, losses to the Cavs and Mavs by 31 and 36 points, respectively. But the streak stopped there, and they somehow beat the Nuggets on Saturday despite a 56-point performance from Nikola Jokić.
Three takeaways

The win over the Nuggets was just the second time since the streak started that the Wizards scored more efficiently than the league average. Jordan Poole led the way with 39 points, but Justin Champagnie added a career-high 23 less than 24 hours after his twin brother scored a career-high 30 for the Spurs.


Jonas Valančiūnas’ numbers were dwarfed by those of Jokić on Saturday, but he had a solid game (20 points, 12 rebounds, five assists, five blocks) against the reigning MVP. Valančiūnas has attempted just 10 3-pointers this season and is having his most efficient year (true shooting percentage of 62.6%) in the last four. He’s the only player who’s shot 55% or better on at least 100 shots from the field and 90% or better on at least 50 free throws.


The Wizards still have a 22-game losing streak in the second games of back-to-backs, getting clobbered on Sunday by the Grizzlies, who had also played the night before and were without Ja Morant and Desmond Bane. So their last four games have been the win vs. Denver and three of their four worst defeats of the season.

The Wizards were shown no mercy when the two new games were announced last week. They’ll face the top two teams in the Eastern Conference, both of which they had previously been scheduled to play just three times. They’re 0-4 against the Cavs and Celtics thus far, having scored less than 97 points per 100 possessions over the four games.

So what's gone wrong over the last week? The offense, which has led the league for most of the season, fell off a cliff with just 110 points per 100 possessions over their last four games. The good news is, their defense has remained stout and they're certainly capable of winning games that way. Luckily for the Cavs, they don't play the dreaded Hawks again until the end of January."

The Thunder have won five straight games (all by double-digits) and are heading to the NBA Cup final, making it clear that they have the league’s No. 1 defense on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Over the previous 28 seasons for which we have play-by-play data, the best defense belonged to the 2003-04 San Antonio Spurs, who allowed 8.3 fewer points per 100 possessions than the league average. The Thunder have been much better than that, allowing 9.4 fewer than the league average. The context is that they’ve played a relatively easy schedule regarding opposing offenses and have had a rest advantage in two of their six games against teams that currently rank in the top 10 offensively.


With the win over the Rockets on Saturday, the Thunder have held their opponent under a point per possession 11 times, two more times than any other team and almost as many times as they did all of last season (13). Going back to April of 2022, the Thunder have won their last 37 games in which they’ve allowed less than a point per possession.


Thunder opponents have taken 44.6% of their shots from 3-point range, the league’s third-highest opponent rate. They could be vulnerable against the Bucks, who rank third in 3-point percentage (38.9%). The percentage of OKC opponent 3-pointers that have been wide open (50%) is a little below the league average.

With their wins over the Mavs and Rockets last week, the Thunder have the best record (11-4) in games played between the 17 teams currently over .500. The Bucks are tied for the third worst (4-8), though they won the one head-to-head meeting last season in which Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard were available.

Playing without Evan Mobley on Friday, the Cavs handled their business against the Wizards, maintaining their one-game advantage in the loss column over the Celtics.
Three takeaways

According to Second Spectrum tracking, that win over Washington was just the fourth time this season that the Cavs shot less effectively than expected (given the quality of their shots). That’s the fewest such games for any team, and overall, only the Knicks have overshot their expected affected field goal percentage more than the Cavs this season.


The first three times where the Cavs shot less effectively than expected, they lost. But they had 18 more shooting opportunities than the Wizards on Friday, with the differential in free throw attempts (40-11) being the second biggest differential in any game this season. That differential took their season-long shooting-opportunity differential into the positive numbers, so they’re right in the middle of the pack regarding possession math.


Though they didn’t shoot well (30%) from 3-point range, 50 (55%) of the Cavs’ 91 field goal attempts came from beyond the arc, with that being their highest rate of the season. So they still outscored the Wizards (45-42) from deep and are now 16-0 (the Grizzlies are the only other undefeated team) when outscoring their opponent from 3-point range.

The Cavs won the possession math both nights as they swept their home-and-home series with the Bucks (by a total of just three points) in early November. They’ll host Milwaukee on Friday after another multi-day break.

The Celtics took care of business against the Pistons and Wizards last week, improving to 12-1 against teams that currently have losing records.
Three takeaways

The Celtics were without Jayson Tatum against Detroit and without Al Horford (rest) on Sunday when Kristaps Porzingis left early with a foot issue. They’ve still had just one game where they had all of their top six guys (starters plus Horford) available.


In addition to destroying opponents from 3-point range, the Celtics also rank second (behind the Nuggets) in free throw differential, having outscored their opponents by 3.6 points per game at the line. They lead the league in opponent free throw rate (19.8 attempts per 100 shots from the field) for the second straight season, with Detroit and Washington totaling just 18 free throw attempts last week.


Payton Pritchard shot 12-for-25 from 3-point range over the two games, becoming the second player (Anthony Edwards was the first) with 100 made 3s this season. The Celtics have scored 121.9 points per 100 possessions with Pritchard on the floor, even though only 115 (15%) of his 745 minutes have come alongside both Tatum and Jaylen Brown.

The only game in which the Celtics have had all six of their top guys was a single-digit win in Chicago less than three weeks ago. They’ll have a home-and-home set with the Bulls this week.

The Mavs’ loss in Oklahoma City in the NBA Cup quarterfinals was their worst offensive performance (104 points on 100 possessions) of the season. Their win at Golden State on Sunday was their best (143 on 101).
Three takeaways

The Thunder took the ball out of Luka Dončić’s hands and he had more turnovers (six) than assists (five), while also shooting just 5-for-15 from the field. Oklahoma City can rotate out of two-on-the-ball situations better than most teams and overall, the Mavs have scored more efficiently when the opponent has used blitz or show coverage against Dončić (1.18 points per possession) than they have otherwise (0.99), according to Second Spectrum tracking.


The Warriors couldn’t take anything away, with Dončić scoring 45 points and assisting on another 34. That total (79 points scored or assisted on) is the highest for any player in a game this season, though just the ninth-highest of his career.


P.J. Washington missed the loss in Oklahoma City but returned on Sunday when the Mavs’ current starting lineup (with Dereck Lively II at the five) eclipsed the 100-minute mark. It was a plus-20 in the 10-point win at Golden State and has now outscored opponents by 22.5 points per 100 possessions, the best mark among the 29 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes.

Having traversed the country multiple times as they’ve played 13 of their last 17 games on the road, the Mavs will now have four days off. That is followed by a four-game homestand that begins with their first two meetings with the Clippers.

A 10-1 stretch took the Grizzlies into second place in the West and was capped by their first win (in three tries) against the Nets. But they came up empty offensively in L.A. on Sunday, falling to 0-3 in California.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies aren’t a jump-shooting team (in a relative sense), taking just 45% of their shots (the league’s fourth-lowest rate) from outside the paint. But they’ve still been rather inconsistent offensively, holding the league’s biggest differential in how effectively they’ve shot in wins (59.4%) vs. losses (49.0%). Ja Morant and Desmond Bane shot a combined 18-for-33 (55%) against Brooklyn but were 9-for-29 (31%) two nights later in L.A.


Zach Edey returned from a 12-game absence on Sunday and played almost twice as many minutes off the bench (24:20) as starting center Brandon Clarke (12:47). The Grizzlies still don’t have a lineup that’s played more than 82 minutes, because their current starting group (which has been playing together for more than a month) has averaged just 10.3 minutes per night together. The Grizzlies are getting 111.2 minutes per game from reserves, 83% more than the Knicks (60.9) and what would be the most for any team with a winning record in (at least) the last 43 seasons.


Though they scored just a point per possession, never led, and trailed by as many as 23 points on Sunday, the Grizzlies lost by only six. So while they’re in second place in the stronger conference, they continue to look better regarding point differential (that of a team that’s 21-6) than wins and losses. They’re the only team in the top five (or in the top seven) on both ends of the floor.

The first two of the Grizzlies’ California losses (the other was at Golden State) came in mid-November without Morant. Their second of four meetings with the Warriors is Thursday in Memphis, where the Grizzlies have won 11 of their last 12.

The Rockets scored less than a point per possession in both of their NBA Cup games last week but were able to win ugly against the Warriors before coming up short in Las Vegas.
Three takeaways

The Rockets were maybe fortunate to have Jalen Green sent to the line with a one-point deficit and 3.5 seconds left on Wednesday, but they also defended the Warriors’ ensuing inbounds play well. They seamlessly switched three straight back-screens and Jabari Smith Jr. reacted well to block Brandin Podziemski’s shot at the buzzer. Houston has won four of its last five games that were within five points in the last five minutes, having allowed just 47 points on 52 clutch possessions over that stretch.


Shooting remains an issue. The Rockets are the only team that ranks in the bottom 10 in field goal percentage in the paint (53.6%, 25th), mid-range field-goal percentage (38.5%, 22nd) and 3-point percentage (32.2%, 28th). The two Cup games last week were the 18th and 19th times they shot worse than expected based on the quality of their shots, according to Second Spectrum tracking. That total (19 games) leads the league.


Missed shots are rebound opportunities and the Rockets had 15 more offensive boards than the Thunder (19-4) on Saturday, winning the possession battle against the team with the best turnover differential in NBA history. They continue to lead the league in shooting opportunity differential (plus 5.8 per game).

The Rockets are just 6-2 against the 11 teams that currently have losing records but will play their next four games against that group. That stretch includes their first two meetings with the Pelicans.

The Knicks were the only home team to lose in the NBA Cup quarterfinals, but they responded with an important win in Orlando to climb past the Magic into third place in the Eastern Conference.
Three takeaways

The loss to the Hawks was the Knicks’ worst offensive performance of the season (100 points on 99 possessions), and may be a testament to how much their offense depends on Jalen Brunson (who was covered pretty well by Dyson Daniels). Though the Knicks added offensive talent in the summer, Brunson has seen a slight drop from last season in the percentage of his minutes on the floor in which he’s had possession of the ball (from 24.3% to 23.8%).


The loss was also the first time the Knicks lost (they were previously 12-0) after winning the first quarter. After holding the Hawks to 47 points on 53 possessions in the first half, they allowed 61 on only 47 after halftime. Overall, the Knicks are 6.0 points per 100 possessions better before halftime (plus-9.6) than they’ve been after (plus-3.6).


The Knicks played just eight guys in both of their wins last week, with the eighth guy (Cameron Payne) totaling less than 23 minutes over the two games. For the season, the Knicks have gotten an average of just 60.9 minutes per game from reserves, which would be the lowest mark for any team in the last 19 seasons and 10 minutes per game fewer than any other team this season (Denver is 29th at 71.0).

The Knicks are 3-3 against the Western Conference, with five of the six games coming on the road. They’ll visit the Wolves and Pelicans (who they beat by 33 points on Dec. 1) this week.

The team that lost eight of its first 10 games will compete for the Emirates NBA Cup on Tuesday.
Three takeaways

The Bucks haven’t been dominant statistically as they’ve won 12 of their last 15 games. While that’s tied for the league’s best record, they rank just ninth in point differential per 100 possessions (plus-5.7), over that stretch. But 10 of the 15 games have been within five points in the last five minutes and they’ve won eight of those 10, having held their opponents to just 84 points on 95 clutch defensive possessions (88.4 per 100).


Khris Middleton has played no more than 23:08 in his four games back, but all four have been within five in the last five and he’s been on the floor down the stretch every time. The Bucks have been at their best with reserves on the floor over those four games. Middleton already has more assists to Giannis Antetokounmpo (15) in just 81 minutes together than everybody on the team except Damian Lillard (52).


Per Second Spectrum tracking, the Thunder lead the league (by a wide margin) with 59.3 drives per 100 possessions The Bucks have allowed 49.9 per 100, the league’s seventh-highest opponent rate, but they rank third in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (53.7%), having seen the league’s third biggest drop from last season. Brook Lopez has the fifth-best rim-protection mark (opponents have shot just 51% when he’s been there) among 78 players who’ve defended at least 75 shots at the rim.

Oklahoma City has the best defense that the Bucks have seen this season, but they won ugly against the second-ranked Rockets four weeks ago.

The Wolves have won six of their last seven games, climbing from 12th to seventh place in the West.
Three takeaways

They’ve also climbed from 12th to fourth in defensive efficiency, having held their opponent under a point per possession in all six wins. The Wolves have been playing good teams, but none of the opponents currently rank higher than 14th offensively. heir game against the third-ranked Knicks on Thursday (with Karl-Anthony Towns making his return to Minnesota) will be a good test.


Amazingly, the Wolves rank 27th offensively over the 6-1 stretch, with Naz Reid, Mike Conley and Donte DiVincenzo all having shot below 40% on at least 45 field goal attempts. But the stifling defense has allowed them to survive some rough shooting nights. They had lost their first eight games in which they shot below 37% from 3-point range, but are 4-0 in those games this month.


The defense ranks first by wide margins in both opponent effective field goal percentage (46.8%) and opponent turnover rate (19.7 per 100 possessions) over the seven games. Over their two wins last week, the Wolves committed 15 fewer turnovers than the Lakers and Spurs.

Two nights after Towns visits, the Wolves will play an even bigger game against the Warriors (one of the two West teams with whom they’re currently tied at 14-11). The much bigger difference when they split two games at Golden State the week before last was on the Warriors’ end of the floor.

The Heat have won four straight after a comeback victory over the Raptors on Thursday.
Three takeaways

The Heat continue to have first-quarter issues and have won the opening period in just six of their 23 games. But they turned a 16-point deficit into a seven-point lead with a 33-10 run to close the first half on Thursday. It was their second win (they’re 2-8) in games they trailed by double-digits.


They would have been in a bigger hole if it weren’t for Duncan Robinson, who was doing everything — passing, cutting, rolling to the rim — but shooting 3-pointers in that first quarter on Thursday. Robinson has seen another jump in the percentage of his shots that have come inside the arc and the Heat offense has been at its best (117.7 points scored per 100 possessions) with him on the floor.


With Jimmy Butler in trade rumors, the Heat have won eight of the last 10 games he’s played in. They’ve been outscored by a single point (scoring just 107.9 per 100 possessions) in 267 total minutes with Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo on the floor without Butler.

The Heat have split two games against the Pistons, with the home team winning both by single digits and with Detroit having a 24-point advantage (36-12) on second chances over the two. The third meeting is Monday in Detroit.

The Magic were less than a minute from reaching the NBA Cup semifinals, but couldn’t close the deal in Milwaukee. Then, they fell to fourth place in the East with their first home loss of the season on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Magic scored relatively efficiently (112.6 points per 100 possessions) over their first two games without Franz Wagner. But their loss to the Knicks on Sunday was the seventh time they’ve scored less than a point per possession. They had just nine such games last season.


One bright spot on Sunday was Tristan da Silva, who scored a career-high 20 points, more than he had in his previous four games combined. The rookie has been a bit of a token starter (like Anthony Black last season) in the Magic’s makeshift lineups, but the latest lineup — with a frontline of da Silva, Wendell Carter Jr. and Goga Bitadze — has allowed less than a point per possession in its 48 minutes over the three games since Wagner’s injury.


The Magic have still played the league’s most road-heavy schedule (17 of 28 on the road), and they still have the league’s biggest home-road differentials regarding both winning percentage (10-1 vs. 7-10) and point differential per 100 possessions (plus-12.9 vs. minus-2.0).

Their loss to the Knicks was the start of the Magic’s longest homestand of the season, seven games over 16 days. But it’s a tough stretch regarding the strength of the opponents, with the first six games coming teams no worse than the 13-10 Heat.

The Nuggets have won two straight games for the first time in more than a month and are back in the top five in the West.
Three takeaways

Their win over the Clippers on Friday was just the ninth time the Nuggets had Jamal Murray (who returned from a two-game absence), Aaron Gordon and Nikola Jokić in the lineup. They’re still just 4-5 in those games, even though they’ve outscored their opponents by 10.9 points per 100 possessions in 226 total minutes with those three guys on the floor together.


The Nuggets don’t shoot a lot of threes (ranking last in 3-point rate by a healthy margin), but they can still dominate inside. They were plus-22 in the restricted area and plus-16 at the free throw line on Friday, even though Jokić had a relatively quiet night (16 points and two assists). For the season, only the Magic (plus-9.1) have outscored their opponents by more points per game than the Nuggets (plus-8.9) when you total restricted-area points and free throws.


The Nuggets’ bench no longer ranks last in the league. That distinction now belongs to the Jazz’s bench after Denver outscored the Hawks and Clippers by 13 points in 31 minutes with Jokić off the floor over these last two wins.

Two other benches in the bottom five are those of the Blazers and Pelicans, who the Nuggets will face on a three-game trip that begins in Sacramento on Monday.

The Warriors had a rough finish in the NBA Cup quarterfinals on Wednesday, fell into a huge hole against Dallas over the weekend, and have have lost eight of their last 10 games.
Three takeaways

The Warriors ranked 27th offensively over the first nine games of this 2-8 stretch. Then they broke out offensively on Sunday, shooting 27-for-54 from 3-point range and committing just 10 turnovers … and still lost to the Mavs by 10. The difference was at the free throw line (18-8), where the Warriors have one of the league’s six worst differentials (minus 3.4 points per game, 27th) for the fifth straight season.


Even with the shootout on Sunday, the Warriors have scored an anemic 89.8 points per 100 possessions in 216 minutes with Stephen Curry off the floor over the last 10 games. So they traded for Dennis Schröder on Sunday, hoping he can keep the offense somewhat afloat.


The question is how much the Warriors will change their offense to accommodate their new point guard. The Nets set 53.0 ball-screens per 100 possessions for Schröder, almost 10 more per 100 than the Warriors set for Chris Paul last season (43.5) and almost 70% more than they’ve set for Curry this year (31.7).

The Warriors’ slide began before they started playing some of the best teams in the league, but they have just two games left on a stretch of 10 straight against teams that currently have winning records, visiting the Grizzlies and Wolves after a three-day break.

The Hawks earned a trip to Las Vegas with an impressive comeback win in New York on Wednesday. But they didn’t have enough down the stretch against the Bucks over the weekend.
Three takeaways

Playing their NBA Cup elimination games against the teams that currently rank third and 11th offensively, the Hawks allowed just 102.9 points per 100 possessions. They rank sixth defensively since Thanksgiving, up from 22nd before the holiday. That’s mostly about opponent 3-point shooting (34.2% vs. 39.4%), but the Hawks have also been better on the defensive glass over these last eight games.


De’Andre Hunter shot just 5-for-16 in Vegas but is still the Hawks’ leading scorer (21.6 points per game) over their last nine games. Hunter hasn’t shot as well inside the arc as he did last season but has been on fire from beyond the arc (52% over the last nine).


The Hawks continue to close games with Hunter on the floor instead of Zaccharie Risacher. Their two lineups with Hunter in place of Risacher (and with either Clint Capela or Onyeka Okongwu at the five) have outscored opponents by 5.0 points per 100 possessions in 156 total minutes.

The Hawks’ schedule remains pretty tough for the next month or so. After playing in San Antonio on Thursday, they’ll begin a four-game homestand with pre-Christmas visits from the Grizzlies and Wolves.

Kevin Durant returned last week and (surprise!) the Suns won both of their games, climbing back into the top six in the West.
Three takeaways

The two wins came over the Jazz and Blazers — and by a total of just 15 points. The defense could have been better both nights, with the two bottom-10 offenses combining to score 121.8 points per 100 possessions against what is now a bottom-10 defense. Phoenix has now allowed 1.2 more points per 100 possessions than it did last season, with only the Pelicans and Nets having seen bigger jumps. (The league average has dropped by 2.1 per 100.)


Durant returned from a three-game absence, but Bradley Beal (knee swelling) missed both games. The Suns have had all three of their stars for just three of their last 16 games. While they’ve outscored their opponents by just 2.1 points per 100 possessions in 175 minutes with all three on the floor, they’re a plus-9.3 per 100 in 216 minutes with Durant and Devin Booker on the floor without Beal.


Tyus Jones totaled 38 points (shooting 8-for-10 from 3-point range) over the two weekend wins, while Jones, Booker and Durant also combined for 43 assists and just six turnovers. With Jones’ addition, the Suns have seen the league’s biggest drop in turnover rate from last season.

Their win over the Blazers on Sunday began a stretch where the Suns are playing five of six at home. That stretch will get tougher after they host the Pacers and Pistons this week, though the Suns have lost their last five games (including one with Durant) against the Eastern Conference.

The Clippers have lost three straight games, sliding from fifth to ninth place in the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

Their loss in Denver on Friday was the sixth time that the Clippers have scored less than a point per possession. They did so just three times all of last season. Overall, they’ve scored 8.2 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season, with only the Pelicans, Sixers and Pacers having seen bigger drop-offs.


The loss in Denver was also his second straight game in which James Harden had more turnovers (nine) than assists (six). In addition to registering the lowest effective field goal percentage of his career (46.7%), Harden has the second-highest turnover rate of his career (14.2 per 100 possessions used).


Kawhi Leonard appears to be getting closer to his season debut. Last season, Leonard was one of three players who played at least 1,000 minutes with their team at least five points per 100 possessions better on both offense and defense when they were on the floor (119.3, 111.1) than when they were off the floor (114.1, 117.9).

After hosting the Jazz on Monday, the Clippers will play eight of their next 10 games on the road, a stretch that begins with their first two games against the team — Dallas — that beat them in the first round of the 2024 playoffs. Their 36 meetings over the last five seasons (in which the Clippers were 20-16) were the most for any pair of Western Conference opponents over that stretch.

Having held on to edge the Pelicans on Thursday, the Kings have won three straight games to climb back to .500 for the first time since they were 8-8.
Three takeaways

The Kings are now 4-2 since moving Malik Monk into the starting lineup on Dec. 1. They have the league’s No. 1 offense over that stretch, with six players averaging at least 12.3 points and four averaging at least 3.7 assists.


The difference in the offense has been more about turnovers and rebounds than shooting. The Kings rank first in turnover rate and fifth in offensive rebounding percentage this month, up from 13th and 19th through November. Monk has an assist/turnover ratio of 41/8, while De’Aaron Fox is one of three starters with at least 13 offensive boards over the six games.


With fewer turnovers and more offensive boards, the Kings have averaged 9.4 more shooting opportunities than their opponents over the six games, having averaged 0.2 fewer through their first 20. Second-chance points were 21-10 in favor of the Kings in their two-point win in New Orleans.

The Kings are one of two teams — the Bulls are the other — with a winning record (7-6) on the road and a losing record (6-7) at home. They play eight of their next nine games at Golden 1 Center, which includes their final three games (two at home) against the Lakers (whom they lost in Week 1).

LeBron James returned from a two-game absence on Sunday and the Lakers got a quality, wire-to-wire (and much-needed) win over the Grizzlies.
Three takeaways

Before the win on Sunday, the Lakers had lost eight of their last 11 games. That slide was about the strength of schedule as much as anything else. The Lakers are 10-1 against the 13 teams currently at or below .500, but just 4-11 against the 17 teams that are currently over .500. That’s the league’s biggest such differential and all four wins against the good teams (two of them over Memphis) have been by seven points or less. Six of the 11 losses have come by 17 points or more.


While the Lakers’ biggest issues have been on defense, the bigger difference vs. the good teams has been on offense. They’ve scored just 106.1 points per 100 possessions over those 15 games against teams currently over .500, compared to 119.8 per 100 against everybody else. The win on Sunday was the Lakers’ fastest-paced game of the season and not all that efficient for either team. L.A. committed a season-high 23 turnovers and shot just 10-for-34 (29%) from 3-point range.


Sunday also brought another lineup change, with Max Christie starting alongside James, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and Anthony Davis for the first time. The other four guys (who’ve all started every game they’ve played in) have now played 237 total minutes over 15 games together. The Lakers are 9-6 in those games but have been outscored by 5.6 points per 100 possessions in those 237 minutes with all four on the floor.

James had a triple-double when the Lakers beat the Kings (who are currently on that .500 line) in Week 1. Their last three meetings with the Kings are in the next two weeks, with a two-game series in Sacramento beginning Thursday.

The Spurs remain just outside the Play-In Tournament group in the West, having split their two games last week.
Three takeaways

Having recorded 66 assists on their 81 field goals last week, the Spurs have an assist rate of 71.3%, the highest rate for any team in the last 21 seasons (topping their mark of 71.2% last season).


The Spurs’ lineup of Chris Paul, Stephon Castle, Julian Champagnie, Harrison Barnes and Victor Wembanyama has outscored opponents by 18.4 points per 100 possessions. That is the second-best mark among 15 lineups that have played at least 150 minutes. But when Castle returned from a one-game absence on Sunday, he came off the bench for the first time since Nov. 4, with Jeremy Sochan starting in his place. The Sochan lineup was good (plus-12 in 13.2 minutes), but bench minutes from Castle and Devin Vassell (who combined to shoot 3-for-19) were rough.


Vassell’s effective field goal percentage for the season (56.5%) is still the best mark of his career. But the Spurs have been outscored by a brutal 17.5 points per 100 possessions in his 271 minutes on the floor, and that number is even worse (minus 20.5 per 100 with anemic offense) in his 125 minutes alongside Wembanyama.

The Spurs are one of three teams — the Hornets and Blazers are the other — that have played just two games against the opposite conference. They’ll host the Hawks on Thursday, having lost both meetings with Atlanta last season.

The Pacers have losses to the Raptors, Nets and Hornets this month, but they may finally be trending in the right direction.
Three takeaways

The opponents haven’t been great; The Pacers’ last six (and 10 of their last 11) games have come against teams with losing records. But their two-weekend wins — over the Sixers and Pelicans — came with their two largest margins of victory this season (14 and 15 points). Ten days ago, they didn’t have a single win that wasn’t within five points in the last five minutes. Now, they have three.


The strength of the opponents (including three teams that rank in the bottom five offensively) is one reason why the last five games have been the Pacers’ best stretch of defense this season (109.0 points allowed per 100 possessions). But the Pacers themselves have had something to with it too. Philly and New Orleans combined to shoot just 46% in the paint, Obi Toppin had eight deflections over the two games, and Myles Turner had four blocks on Sunday.


Toppin had been the backup center before Sunday when the Pacers traded for Thomas Bryant. They needed another big body, but they haven’t been bad (plus-3.2 points per 100 possessions) in 239 minutes with a frontline of Toppin and Pascal Siakam. Improving in Turner’s minutes on the floor will be more important than what Bryant gives them going forward.

If the Pacers are indeed improving, we’re going to find out in the next few weeks. Their next nine games — a stretch bookended by games against the Suns — are all against teams currently at or above .500, with seven of those nine against teams that rank in the top 10 offensively. They’ll have a rest advantage in Sacramento on Sunday.

Joel Embiid is injured again, and he isn’t the only one. Embiid suffered a sinus fracture and Jared McCain tore the meniscus in his left knee in the Sixers’ loss to Indiana on Friday.
Three takeaways

Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey have played in three games together and in two of those three games, one of the three guys (George or Embiid) has been unavailable for the second half. They’ve played 45 minutes together total, with ugly offense on both ends of the floor (83.8 combined points scored per 100 possessions) in those 45 minutes.


Embiid and George were on the floor for all of the 14-0, first-quarter Indiana run that the Sixers never fully recovered from on Friday (Maxey was off for just two of those 14 points). They’ve lost the first quarter by at least nine points in five of their last eight games and are now 1-16 in games they’ve trailed by double-digits.


McCain will be missed. The Sixers’ offense has been much better with him on the floor and he would be the first rookie guard in the last 15 seasons to average at least 20 points per 36 minutes (minimum 500 total minutes) with an effective field goal percentage of 55% or higher.

The Sixers had won four of five before the loss to the Pacers, they still have the best record (6-3) in games played between the eight East teams currently below .500, and they’ll get two games against the Hornets this week. Embiid is listed as out for their game in Charlotte on Monday.

The Bulls are 1-2 on a stretch of four straight games against other East teams with losing records, picking up a relatively ugly win over the Hornets on Friday.
Three takeaways

The win over Charlotte was comfortable, despite the Bulls (playing without Nikola Vučević) scoring just 109 points on 105 possessions. It was just their second victory (the first was in October) in a game in which they’ve scored less than 118 per 100. They had 16 such victories last season, even though they had a bottom-10 defense overall.


The Bulls shot 27% from 3-point range and still outscored the Hornets by 18 points from beyond the arc, with the two teams combining to miss 75 3-pointers. The Bulls have taken more than half of their shots from 3-point range in five of their last six games and they’re about to play the Celtics twice this week. It should be noted that the record for combined 3-point attempts in a game is 111, set by the Bucks and Hawks (in an overtime game) in March of 2019. These two teams came six short of the record when the Celtics won in Chicago less than three weeks ago.


Lonzo Ball has played (106 total minutes) in six of the last seven games. He hasn’t shot well (38%), but has 20 assists, 10 steals (3.4 per 36) and just three turnovers over that stretch, with the Bulls scoring 118.7 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor.

The Bulls will finish this stretch within the bottom eight in the East with a visit to Toronto on Monday. Then they’ll play five straight games against the East’s top seven, with four of those five against the Celtics and Bucks.

The Nets have lost five of their last six games and just traded their most important player regarding their somewhat surprising start.
Three takeaways

The Nets made a trade with the Rockets in the summer to get their own 2025 first-round pick back, so it’s no surprise that they would lean into losing more games at some point. But they wasted no time in sending Dennis Schröder to the Warriors, doing so on the first day that the injured De’Anthony Melton (coming back with some second-round picks) was trade-eligible.


The Nets’ offense, which ranked in the top 10 just two weeks ago, has been at its best with Dorian Finney-Smith on the floor. But it’s scored just 107.1 points per 100 possessions in 102 minutes with Finney-Smith and Cam Johnson on the floor without Schröder.


Starting Ben Simmons at point guard (and assuming that Nic Claxton remains the starting center) would mean having two non-shooters on the floor. Simmons hasn’t made a shot from outside the paint since Feb. of 2023 and has played just 85 (19%) of his 447 minutes with Claxton or Day’Ron Sharpe.

The Nets have played just five of their 25 games against teams that currently rank in the bottom 10 defensively. They’ll play two more this week, visiting the Raptors and hosting the Jazz.

The Pistons have lost four of their last five games, and they’ve lost 12 straight to the Celtics after getting clobbered in Boston on Thursday.
Three takeaways

It’s been a tough, five-game stretch, with four of the five against the Celtics (x 2), Bucks and Knicks. And it’s been the Pistons’ worst five-game stretch, both offensively (107.1 points scored per 100 possessions) and defensively (120.6 allowed per 100) this season.


Cade Cunningham has averaged 24.3 points (on an effective field goal percentage of 57%), 8.0 rebounds and 10.8 assists over the 1-4 stretch. But he missed the Pistons’ loss to the Sixers and the team has scored just 95.5 points per 100 possessions in his 102 total minutes off the floor in the last 16 days.


Jaden Ivey has shot a career-best 36.7% from 3-point range, but the Celtics were willing to let him to shoot on Thursday, going under screens and backing off him in transition. That 3-point percentage breaks down to 30-for-71 (42.3%) on catch-and-shoot attempts and 16-for-56 (28.6%) on pull-ups. That’s the fifth biggest differential among 48 players with at least 50 attempts of each, with Malik Beasley (44.7% vs. 33.8%) having the sixth biggest.

The Pistons and Heat have split their two meetings thus far, with Detroit winning at home last month when Erik Spoelstra called a timeout he didn’t have. Their third meeting is back in Detroit on Monday and will be the Pistons’ fourth straight game against a team that ranks in the top 10 offensively.

Still awaiting the return of Immanuel Quickley (who last played Nov. 10), the Raptors have lost Scottie Barnes again, this time to a badly sprained ankle suffered in their loss to the Knicks last Monday.
Three takeaways

With their loss in Miami on Thursday, the Raptors are 2-10 without Barnes, though they’ve been better offensively in those games (112.4 points scored per 100 possessions) than in the 14 he’s played (109.2). That difference has been about turnovers more than shooting and they did win the turnover battle (while shooting poorly) against the Heat.


The Raptors continue to rank last in both opponent free throw rate (30.6 attempts per 100 shots from the field) and free throw differential (minus-4.8 points per game). They were outscored by 10 points at the line in their 10-point loss on Thursday when Davion Mitchell fouled out in less than 21 minutes. Mitchell (4.0) and Jamal Shead (4.7) are two of the 13 guards who’ve played at least 300 minutes and committed at least four fouls per 36.


The Raptors erased an 11-point deficit against the Knicks on Monday, but couldn’t get the stop they needed in the final minute and remain one of three teams — the Pistons and Jazz are the others — that haven’t won a game they’ve trailed by double-digits (0-16).

The Raptors are back home for a three-game homestand this week, facing the Bulls, Nets and Rockets all for the first time. They’re currently 3-3 (3-1 at home) in games played between the eight East teams with losing records.

The Hornets are 1-1 in a stretch of five straight games (four on the road) within the bottom eight in the Eastern Conference, having lost an ugly one in Chicago on Friday.
Three takeaways

Over their first five games without LaMelo Ball, the Hornets scored just as efficiently (109.1 points per 100 possessions) as they did over their 18 games with him in uniform. But they scored just 95 on 105 possessions on Friday, their worst shooting night (8-for-46 from 3-point range) of the season. Overall, they’ve scored just 102.6 per 100 in 596 total minutes with Ball off the floor.


Mark Williams has played in four of the last five games and got his first start on Friday. He’s still played just 47 total minutes (in which the Hornets have been outscored by 38 points), but has averaged 28.1 points (on 68% shooting), 16.7 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per 36.


With Williams and Moussa Diabaté, the Hornets have two of the top five players in offensive rebounding percentage. They’ve outscored their opponents by 4.7 second-chance points per game, the league’s best differential.

The Hornets still have a winning record (5-4) in games played between the eight East teams that are currently below .500, and they’ve yet to face the last-place Wizards, who they’ll visit on Thursday.

The Jazz were competitive against the Suns on Friday, but they’ve lost 11 of their last 13 and remain tied in the win column with the last-place Pelicans.
Three takeaways

The loss on Friday was the second time in their last three games that the Jazz have scored more than 130 points per 100 possessions. Their 13 corner 3-pointers (including four from John Collins) against the Suns are tied for the fifth most for any team in any game (including playoffs) in the 29 seasons for which we have shot-location data. Jordan Clarkson returned from a seven-game absence and scored 23 points in less than 31 minutes off the bench.


Alas, it was also the second straight game in which the Jazz allowed more than 140 per 100 and the only time in NBA history that both teams made at least 22 3-pointers. Going back to last January, the Jazz have been the opponent in six of the last 20 regular-season games in which a team has scored more than 140 points per 100 possessions. Those two games (along with some not-so-terrible defense from the Wizards) has the Jazz last in defensive efficiency for what would be the second straight season.


The Suns are a potent offensive team (especially with Kevin Durant back in the lineup), but the Jazz defense was also pretty porous. There were several instances of miscommunication on switches and the Utah zone yielded open shots pretty easily.

The Jazz will play their next five games on the road, with three of the five against bottom-10 offenses and another — Saturday in Brooklyn — against a middle-of-the-pack offense that just lost its point guard.

The Blazers have been relatively competitive (no 40-point losses) over the last eight days, but they’ve dropped six straight games, becoming the sixth team that’s at least 10 games below .500.
Three takeaways

The Blazers’ top three centers — Deandre Ayton, Donovan Clingan and Robert Williams III — have all missed a bunch of games over the last several weeks. Jabari Walker started at the five against the Spurs on Friday, when the Blazers closed with a frontline of Deni Avdija and Jerami Grant. They’ve played 71 total minutes with Grant at the five (no Ayton, Clingan, Duop Reath, Walker or Williams on the floor), and have only been outscored by four points (with the Blazers and their opponents combining to scored 125 per 100 possessions) in those 71 minutes.


Avdija totaled 36 points on 13-for-20 shooting in the Blazers’ two games over the weekend. After registering an effective field goal percentage of just 39.3% through the Blazers’ first 13 games, he has a mark of 60.0% over the last 13.


With the younger guards that the Blazers need to develop, 25-year-old Dalano Banton is somewhat of an afterthought on this roster. But Banton has been playing regular minutes off the bench and the Blazers (who have the league’s fourth-worst point differential overall) have somehow outscored their opponents by 32 points in his 400 total minutes on the floor. The much bigger difference between his minutes on and off the floor has been on offense.

The Blazers have played just two games against the Eastern Conference, but still have five games left on a stretch of 12 straight against the West. Their first meeting of the season with the Nuggets (to whom they’ve lost seven straight) is Thursday in Portland.

Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson remain on the shelf, and the Pelicans have lost 19 of their last 21 games.
Three takeaways

The four healthy guys in the Pelicans’ top six – Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum, Herb Jones and Trey Murphy III – have still played only 82 total minutes together (over five games). But the Pels have also been outscored (by 1.6 points per 100 possessions) in those 82 minutes. So they’re not yet winning when they have their best (available) players on the floor.


Murray has an effective field goal percentage of 51.9% over his last five games, up from 31.8% over his first four games back from an extended absence. But he also had 16 turnovers over the Pels’ two losses last week, and that doesn’t count him getting stripped on his way up with the team down two in the final seconds against the Kings on Thursday.


The loss to the Kings dropped the Pels to 4-6 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, with four of the six losses having come at home. Overall, they’ve only been outscored by 4.8 points per game at Smoothie King Center, but their minus-17.6 per game on the road would be the worst road mark for any team in the last 32 seasons.

The Pels’ longest homestand of the season (five games over 10 days) begins Saturday, but their next seven games are against teams with winning records and they’ll be at a rest-disadvantage against the Nuggets on Sunday.

The Wizards got the Cavs and Celtics for their two extra games and actually brought their season-long point differential down, losing the two games by a total of just 24 points.
Three takeaways

The Wizards have actually had the league’s best defense vs. Boston, having allowed just 110.3 points per 100 possessions over three meetings. The defensive numbers weren’t too bad in Cleveland (or in their win against Denver the week before), and the Wizards have climbed out of the basement on that end of the floor. But they continue to get clobbered on the glass, having allowed their last five opponents to retain 35.7% of available offensive rebounds.


Bilal Coulibaly has averaged a team-high 21.0 points and 5.0 assists over the last three games (against three top-10 defenses), and only 11 of his 24 buckets over that stretch have been assisted. He’s averaged 2.7 minutes of possession (7.7% of his minutes on the floor) this season, up from 1.2 minutes (4.4%) last season.


The Wizards’ point differential (minus-15.8 points per game) is still the worst in NBA history, but only three of their 24 games have come against the other 10 teams that currently have losing records.

They’ve lost all three of those games (by 12 points or more), but they’ll play the shorthanded Hornets twice (at home) in the next two weeks, with the first meeting on Thursday.

Even after a big upset win over the Denver Nuggets on Friday (that led to Jordan Poole's new ""drowning in the Poole?"" celebration above), the Washington Wizards are on track for one of the absolute worst seasons in NBA history.
Just look at that net rating. Last season, the Charlotte Hornets had the worst mark in the league, and they were at minus-10.6. The year before, the low mark was minus-9.9.
And when you combine point differential with strength of schedule (as Basketball Reference's ""simple rating system"" does), Washington is on track for the third-worst season on record. Only the 1992-93 Dallas Mavericks (who went 11-71) and the 2011-12 Charlotte Bobcats (7-59) have lower marks in SRS.

With the possible exception of Simons, who's still just 25 years old, Portland should be interested in and motivated to move all of the above (and Deandre Ayton, assuming there's any interest).

The Charlotte Hornets were already losing sight of the play-in tournament before LaMelo Ball went down with a calf injury, and his absence has certainly accelerated the decline.
Ball's missed Charlotte's past six games, and the Hornets have just one win during that stretch (against the sub-.500 Indiana Pacers).
There is a silver lining, though, and it's trailing 6'9"" NBA sophomore Brandon Miller.
When he came into the league, the floor for Miller seemed to be ""quality three-and-D wing."" But his playmaking and volume as a three-point shooter, especially since Ball went down, are showing he can develop into much more.
During this six-game run, Miller is averaging 27.2 points and a whopping 4.7 threes. For the entire season, he's averaging 3.5 assists.
The experience he's adding as a No. 1 option now will only help him help Ball upon the superstar guard's return."

The Indiana Pacers have been one of this season's most disappointing and confounding teams.
In 2023-24, they were second in points per 100 possessions and second in effective field-goal percentage.
In terms of roster construction, the only significant differences are the addition of Pascal Siakam (who was picked up in a trade less than a year ago) and bigger roles for Bennedict Mathurin and Jarace Walker.
You'd think that would be enough to overcome long-term absences for Aaron Nesmitih and Andrew Nembhard, but those two may have been more important to the team's success than we realized, especially if Tyrese Haliburton isn't going to rediscover his All-NBA form.
Haliburton is still the team leader in wins over replacement player, but his 17.5 points, 8.4 assists and below-average 52.0 effective field-goal percentage pale in comparison to the 24.4 points, 12.8 assists and 60.4 effective field-goal percentage he posted in his first 31 games of 2023-24."

They're 3-8 in their last 11. And over that stretch, their minus-7.6 net rating is better than only the Los Angeles Lakers, Portland Trail Blazers, New Orleans Pelicans and Washington Wizards.
It's not all bad for Detroit, though. Even if the Pistons wind up in the lottery again, this is, by far, the best individual campaign of Cade Cunningham's young career.
After Thursday's loss to the Boston Celtics, the 2021 No. 1 overall pick is at 23.6 points, 9.3 assists, 7.3 rebounds and 2.4 threes, with a 38.1 three-point percentage.
The game seems to have slowed down for the 23-year-old, his teammates are a little more reliable after he finds them. And perhaps most importantly, he's knocking down his own jumpers.
If Cunningham keeps this up and one or two other members of the young core start to catch up, the Pistons may still have a shot to get to play-in range."

The Chicago Bulls are in a situation similar to that of the Brooklyn Nets. Both teams are hovering a little closer to .500 than maybe some of the pro-tanking crowd would like, and both teams have some veterans they can potentially unload to expedite the tank.

Now over a quarter of the way into the season, Vučević is averaging 21.0 points, 9.8 rebounds and 3.2 assists. He's in the 91st percentile in Dunks and Threes' single-season estimated plus-minus.
LaVine, meanwhile, is averaging 22.1 points, 4.2 assists and 3.3 threes, while shooting 43.2 percent from deep. His contract is a little more daunting that Vuč's (he's potentially owed $49 million in 2026-27, when he has a player option), but that's the kind of production that could push a fringe contender closer to the Boston Celtics are Oklahoma City Thunder."

Yes, the Sixers deserve some credit for going 5-3 in their past eight (and winning four of their past five), but that conference lifeline did its share, too. Now that two of Philadelphia's stars are filtering back into the rotation, it feels like its climb up the standings is just beginning.
Over the last five games, Paul George is averaging 18.3 points, 6.0 assists and 2.3 threes, while shooting 39.1 percent from deep.

Stephon Castle is up to the second shortest odds for that award, and that shift isn't due entirely to his perimeter defense (though that's probably what eventually made him a staple of the rotation).

His shooting percentages suggest he still has some work to do in terms of consistency, but that's to be expected for plenty of rookie guards. He's ahead of schedule as a playmaker and defender. And if his shooting catches up, San Antonio will have one of the league's most intriguing young duos."

On balance, this has undoubtedly been a disappointing season for the Denver Nuggets. That was highlighted this past weekend when they lost to the worst team in the NBA (the Washington Wizards were nursing a 16-game losing streak before bombarding Denver with 11 more threes than the Nuggets made).
But there may still be reason to believe Denver can get back into the title hunt.
First, the Nuggets' underwhelming record has come in the face of several absences from three of the team's four best players. Nikola Jokić missed three for personal reasons, Jamal Murray has missed five, and Aaron Gordon has missed 11.
When all three of those players are on the floor, Denver is plus-12.6 points per 100 possessions.
But of course, the biggest reason we can't count this team out yet, even if it's not living up to its potential now, is the presence of the world's best player on the roster.
After an eye-popping two-game stretch in which he registered 104 points, 30 rebounds, 16 assists and four steals in a span of about 24 hours, Jokić is now averaging 32.3 points, 13.6 rebounds, 10.2 assists and 1.8 steals, with a 64.9 true shooting percentage 7.4 points clear of the league average.

Then, after Banchero went down, Franz Wagner averaged 26.1 ponits, 6.3 assists, 6.0 rebounds and 1.8 steals over the next 20 games.
But this past week, we learned that he too would be out for an extended period of time with—and it's hard to believe this is true—a torn oblique.
This season, in almost 700 non-garbage time possessions, Orlando is minus-8.3 points per 100 possessions when both stars are off the floor.
But the absences didn't prevent them from being competitive in their NBA Cup quarterfinal matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday, thanks in large part to Jalen Suggs.
With the offense now squarely resting on his shoulders, Suggs had 32 points on 26 shots. He was a positive in the plus-minus column, despite the Magic falling.
All things considered, it was a good sign ahead of what could be a long and painful stretch of basketball. Orlando is likely to lose more games than it wins before Banchero and Wagner return, but its defense and competitiveness should be able to keep it from falling too far down the standings to recover."

James Harden went 1-of-10 from the field in just under 25 minutes against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday and then missed Sunday's tilt against the Houston Rockets.
To no one's surprise, the Los Angeles Clippers dropped both of those games.
Still, this team is undoubtedly performing better than expected, given their circumstances. When Paul George bolted in free agency and it started to become clear that Kawhi Leonard would miss a lot of time, it would've been easy to count L.A. out of the playoff hunt.
But Norman Powell's shooting (he's averaging 23.6 points and 3.8 threes, while shooting 48.6 percent from three), three-and-D contributions from Derrick Jones Jr. and Amir Coffey and the pick-and-roll game of Harden and Ivica Zubac have kept the Clippers more than afloat."

It may be time for the Golden State Warriors to abandon this ""play everyone on the roster and a couple ball boys, when necessary"" philosophy.
Steve Kerr played 11 different players in a hotly contested NBA Cup quarterfinal on Wednesday. The Warriors have 12 players with at least 300 minutes already (and that doesn't include the injured De'Anthony Melton. No one else in the league has more than 10. And Curry is only playing 30.7 minutes per game (his lowest average ever, when you filter out two seasons cut short by injuries).
All of this may be beneficial to preserve 36-year-old Stephen Curry's legs. It might also be juicing (or at least attempting to juice) the trade values of some young players.
But without another bona fide scoring star on the roster, Golden State probably needs a shorter rotation that includes more minutes for Curry. On the season, the Warriors have a point differential around that of a 64-win team when Curry is on the floor and one around that of a 31-win team when he's off."

The Minnesota Timberwolves ended their week with a road loss the Golden State Warriors, but they'd just beaten Stephen Curry and company to cap off a four-game winning streak prior to that.
And after falling two games below .500 in late November, it feels like the team is generally headed in a good direction.
Despite what may look like an underwhelming record, Minnesota is creeping toward the top half of the league in offense and the top five in defense, but the Timberwolves may need to make one more trade to really accelerate their rise.
The offense still feels a little more cramped than it should when Julius Randle is in the game, and the defense definitely suffers in those minutes. On the season, Minnesota is plus-1.6 points per 100 possessions when Randle plays and plus-8.8 when he doesn't."

From a distance, the Milwaukee Bucks season still looks a little underwhelming. They're only two games above .500 with a net rating that only recently crept over zero.
But it's probably already fair to put them back on the title contender's tier given how they've performed over the past few weeks.
The Bucks are 11-3 over their past 14 games. Khris Middleton is back and already looks a little more spry than most could've predicted after surgeries on both ankles. And Giannis Antetokounmpo is playing like an MVP for the... *checks notes*...seventh straight season.
After going for 37 points in Milwaukee's NBA Cup quarterfinal win on Tuesday, Giannis is averaging a league-best 32.7 points to go with 11.4 rebounds and 6.0 assists. And perhaps most encouraging, shots outside his range have been almost entirely eliminated.
From 2018-19 through 2022-23, Giannis took 3.5 threes per game, shot 28.8 percent from three and had a 62.5 true shooting percentage. Since then, he's taking 1.5 threes (just 0.8 this season) and had a 64.4 true shooting percentage."

The New York Knicks suffered a tough home loss in the quarterfinals of the in-season tournament, but the Atlanta Hawks are one of the hottest teams in the league, the Knicks still have a top-three offense and they're on pace for 49 wins with a defense hovering around the middle of the NBA.
It's that last part that's maybe most surprising. Tom Thibodeau's teams are typically pretty locked in on the defensive end of the floor, but the same hasn't been true of Karl-Anthony Towns.
Prior to Rudy Gobert joining the Minnesota Timberwolves, that team was almost always below average in points allowed per 100 possessions when KAT was on the floor. And the ability to embrace the Towns-Gobert blueprint may still be a ways away. ESPN's Shams Charania reported that Mitchell Robinson may not be back till late January or early February.
That means, at least for now, New York is going to have to keep winning shootouts and hoping Josh Hart, Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby can stitch together enough defense to survive."

The Dallas Mavericks ran into a buzzsaw in the NBA Cup on Tuesday, losing to the Oklahoma City Thunder (in OKC), 118-104.
The Thunder were in control of that contest for much of the second half, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander pretty thoroughly outperformed Luka Dončić. And if you're looking at that one as a Dallas fan, you might be a little concerned about a potential playoff matchup.
But the more short-term takeaways for the Mavs this week are still undoubtedly positive. They'd won 11 of 12 games prior to Tuesday's matchup with OKC. And that stretch included a road win over the Thunder. P.J. Washington, who might be Dallas' best shot to at least slow SGA down, missed the most recent loss.
And though he had an underwhelming 16 points on 15 shots Tuesday, Dončić does appear to be rounding back into his MVP form recently. In his five games since returning from injury (which includes Tuesday), he's averaging 28.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 4.0 threes and 3.4 steals(!), while shooting 40.0 percent from deep."

If my mentions are any indication, Cleveland Cavaliers fans are understandably frustrated by their team's lack of upward mobility in these power rankings.
They've had the best record in the league for most of the season, their net rating has hovered at or near the top throughout, and their big four of Darius Garland, Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen looks great.
But they've also played the second-easiest schedule in the league to date (only the Memphis Grizzlies' has been easier), and now may be a good time to remind readers of one of the key factors in this exercise.
Basketball Reference's Playoff Probabilities Report still lists the Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder ahead for chances of winning the finals. And FanDuel still has them fifth in title odds.
There are certainly reasons to disagree with either of those assertions, but it's also reasonable to still think Boston has the better shot at emerging from the East (despite Cleveland being 1-1 against the Celtics this season).
This Boston group has already gone all the way. And fair or not, it's naturally easier to trust the championship chances of those teams and stars that have titles on their resumes."

At this point, the Oklahoma City Thunder feel about as juggernaut-like as the Boston Celtics.
They have a double-digit net rating and are on pace for 65 wins in the absolutely loaded Western Conference.
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is a metronome for MVP-like production. Since the start of the 2022-23 season, he leads the league in 25-point games (at 134) and 25-point, five-assist, two-steal games (at 60).
Isaiah Hartenstein looks like exactly the kind of rebounding, passing and rim-protecting big that the team needed in the 2024 playoffs.
And perhaps most encouraging, Jalen Williams has joined SGA in playing like a top-10 player. Yes, top 10. The catch-all metrics love Williams. He's sixth in Basketball Reference's box plus/minus, sixth in Dunks and Threes' estimated plus-minus and averaging 21.8 points, 5.0 assists, 2.0 steals and 2.0 threes.
Add to all that the fact that Chet Holmgren—another player who can perform like a top 20-25 player—will likely be back from a hip injury before the playoffs, and it's getting pretty tough to imagine anyone else representing the West in the NBA Finals."

The Boston Celtics have given us plenty of reasons to highlight them throughout these first couple months of the season. And the obvious recipients of the attention have been Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White and maybe even Kristaps Porziņģis after his return from injury.
But one of the most important pieces of this title defense might also be the most underappreciated: backup guard Payton Pritchard.
After the 26-year-old put up team highs in points (27) and assists (10) in Thursday's win over the Detroit Pistons, he is now averaging 16.5 and 3.2 for the season. He's shooting 43.2 percent from deep.
And when he's on the floor, Boston is outscoring opponents by 8.0 points per 100 possessions. That's obviously a little lower than the team rating, but when you have a backup beating teams that bad, you know you have a juggernaut of a team."

As the 2024-25 campaign continues to unravel for the Charlotte Hornets, their older players have somehow escaped the trips around the rumor mill, unlike veterans on other rebuilding squads.

Miles Bridges has averaged 20.6 points, 9.3 rebounds and 4.4 assists in eight games since returning from injury, and he's on a relatively team-friendly contract that pays him $27.2 million and declines in each of the next two seasons.
Seth Curry is shooting 41.9 percent from three. Vasilije Micić is averaging 6.3 assists per 75 possessions, while Cody Martin is a solid playmaker and defender for a reserve wing.

And they're still within shouting distance of a bottom-five record and at least a 10.5 percent shot at the No. 1 draft pick in 2025.
If they keep heading down the standings while getting encouraging performances from young players around the roster, even better.
Lately, plenty of those have been coming from Deni Avdija. Over his last 13 games, the 24-year-old forward is averaging 17.1 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists, while shooting 42.9 percent from deep."

Behind 12 assists from the recently acquired D'Angelo Russell and 26 points from Cameron Johnson, the Brooklyn Nets snuck up on the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday, winning 113-110.
The game was perhaps a reminder that even though Brooklyn unloaded Dennis Schröder and Dorian Finney-Smith in rebuild-minded trades, the East is weak enough for what's left of the team to hurt its lottery odds with random wins.
The Nets might have to find new homes for both Johnson and Russell between now and the trade deadline to truly enter the race for 2025's top overall pick."

The Sacramento Kings, in the middle of what ended up a six-game losing streak, fired coach Mike Brown on Saturday.
And though they ended their week with back-to-back wins over the Luka Dončić-less Dallas Mavericks and Joel Embiid-less Philadelphia 76ers, it certainly doesn't feel like the team is in the clear after this move.
Staying in reach of the play-in tournament is harder in the West than it is in the East. DeMar DeRozan's on-ball-heavy offense and sometimes nonexistent defense have made him a tricky fit. Keegan Murray's bizarre inability to hit threes remains. And when Malik Monk starts, the bench can seem woefully underpowered.
Axing Brown isn't likely to fix all of that overnight. And if the Kings remain underwhelming, expect the De'Aaron Fox trade rumors to just keep getting louder."

It's become pretty clear this version of the Chicago Bulls, currently in 10th place after losing to the dreadful Washington Wizards on Wednesday, doesn't have a ceiling much higher than where they are now.
And staying there could be a terrible mistake.
The Bulls only keep their 2025 first-round pick if it lands in the top 10, so they need to unload Zach LaVine and Nikola Vučević sooner than later, lose a little more consistently and truly turn the page toward a new era."

We're barely into the new year, and the Detroit Pistons have officially surpassed last season's win total. They're also on pace to smash their preseason over-under of 25.5 wins.
While the coaching change from Monty Williams to J.B. Bickerstaff, the addition of some veteran talent and improved play from Jaden Ivey are all keys to the improvement, nothing has been more important than Cade Cunningham's breakout.
After scoring 19 points, handing out nine assists and going 4-of-6 from deep in Wednesday's win over the Orlando Magic, he is putting up 23.8 points and 9.7 assists while shooting 37.2 percent from three.
Cunningham is playing like an All-Star (or at least a fringe All-Star), and that should be enough to keep Detroit in the mix for an Eastern Conference play-in spot."

The Philadelphia 76ers hit some bumps in the road in California, closing out their week with back-to-back losses to the Sacramento Kings and Golden State Warriors, but things are still heading in the right general direction.
Philadelphia is 10-5 in its last 15. Tyrese Maxey, Paul George and Joel Embiid are finally stringing some starts with each other together. And Embiid has rediscovered his trademark ability to dominate from the free-throw line.

Devin Booker returned from a five-game absence on New Year's Eve, but he wasn't able to stop the Phoenix Suns' slide down the Western Conference standings.
Booker had nine assists, but it took him 20 shots to get to his 16 points in Tuesday's loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. His team has now dropped six of its last seven.
For an organization with three huge names (on huge contracts), being below .500 at this point of the season is a borderline disaster. And the natural inclination for fans is probably: They need to shake things up with a trade.
But the Suns are beyond leveraged. They unloaded just about all of their trade capital to acquire Kevin Durant in February of 2023 and Bradley Beal in the following offseason. The former is still one of the league's best scorers, but he's 36. It's hard to imagine anyone signing up to take on the contract of the latter.
The only real asset Phoenix can move now is Booker, and the only reason to do that is to tip off a full-scale rebuild. After the big game Mat Ishbia has talked since buying the team just before the KD deal, he's probably not ready to swallow that pill yet.
That means the Suns might be forced to simply wait this out, hope that Durant, Beal and Booker stay healthy enough to stay in the play-in range and all happen to get hot at the same time in April, May and (if everything suddenly falls into place) June."

It hasn't been the fastest climb, but the Indiana Pacers are working their way up the Eastern Conference standings to a position closer to where many expected prior to this season.
They're 8-4 in their last 12, which has been good enough to put them within striking distance of the East's top six, especially after they ended the week with a win over one of the teams above them.
On Thursday, Tyrese Haliburton led the Pacers to a 128-115 victory. He had 33 points and 15 assists.
On the season, Indiana is now 8-0 when the 24-year-old totals at least 12 assists (and 11-3 when he's over 10)."

The injury-ravaged Orlando Magic are sliding down the Eastern Conference standings, but that's likely happening a little slower than most expected.
The Magic are a respectable 4-6 since Franz Wagner went down with his torn oblique, and they're getting seemingly random breakout performances from all over the roster in their wins.
On Sunday, rookie Tristan da Silva led a furious comeback win over the Brooklyn Nets with 21 points, seven assists and four threes. The win before that, over the Boston Celtics, he had 18. And on the Saturday ahead of Christmas, Cole Anthony exploded for 35.
Of course, losses are interspersed with the wins now. And the players who are upright are as likely to have a cold night as a hot one. But Jamahl Mosley has the defense competing every night. And if da Silva, Anthony or Jalen Suggs hit a few threes, they have a chance.
That formula should be good enough to at least keep Orlando in or around the softer Eastern Conference's play-in range until Paolo Banchero and Franz are back."

It's been a rough month and a half for the Golden State Warriors. After starting 12-4, they went 4-12 in their next 16.
But on Thursday, Stephen Curry put together a performance that reminded everyone he's still capable of completely taking over a game.
The 36-year-old had 30 points on 11-of-15 shooting, including 8-of-8 from three. He also handed out 10 assists.

And while it may be tempting to react to a 139-105 win over the Philadelphia 76ers by saying the current roster is pretty good after all, the stronger take is that this should just be more motivation to make a win-now deal.
The Paris Olympics and performances like this are evidence that Curry is still capable of being the best player on a title contender. And the organization owes it to him to surround the 10-time All-Star with a championship-caliber supporting cast."

It feels like the Jimmy Butler trade rumors have yet to work their way into the collective psyche of the Miami Heat, especially after news of his desire to leave broke late Thursday night.
ESPN story with @WindhorstESPN: Jimmy Butler has indicated to the Miami Heat that he wants the team to trade him and is open to playing anywhere other than Miami.https://t.co/6BovsL2qdi
That report came after a loss in which Miami gave up 128 to the Indiana Pacers, and Butler attempted just six shots in the game (and only took two free throws).
For now, though, however the drama plays out, Butler's potential heir apparent is demonstrating his ability to be a consistent No. 1 option.

The Cavs have won 10 of their last 11 games and now have a five-game lead in the loss column over the Celtics at the top of the Eastern Conference.
Three takeaways

The Cavs are 7-0 against the Western Conference after beginning a four-game trip with a 149-135 win in Denver on Friday. We’ve been waiting for the Cleveland offense to cool off a bit, but the win was the Cavs’ most efficient offensive performance of the season (149 on 106 possessions). It was the second time in their three seasons together (the first time since a double-OT win in Nov. 2022) that Darius Garland, Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen all scored 20 points or more.


The Cavs have now scored 9.2 more points per 100 possessions than the league average (112.5), which would be the biggest differential in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data, topping that of the 2003-04 Mavs (9.0). Their effective field goal percentage of 59.7% would be the best mark in NBA history by a huge margin.


The Nuggets shot 15-for-31 (48%) from 3-point range, but the Cavs (23-for-48) still outscored them by 24 points from beyond the arc. Cleveland has taken 52% of its shots from 3-point range over its six-game winning streak and remains the only undefeated team (21-0) when outscoring its opponent from deep.

That perfect record vs. the West will be on the line as the Cavs complete their four-game trip this week. They’ll be at a rest disadvantage in L.A. on Tuesday, but will then have the first two days of 2025 off before visiting the Mavs.

The Thunder have an 11-game winning streak (second longest in the league this season) and began a tough, five-game homestand with a win over the Morant-less Grizzlies on Sunday, putting them six games in the loss column ahead of both Houston and Memphis at the top of the West.
Three takeaways

Weekend wins over the Hornets and Grizzlies were the 13th and 14th times the Thunder have held their opponent under a point per possession. Only two other teams — the Wolves (9) and Celtics (8) — have done it more than half as many times. Oklahoma City continues to have the best defense in the 29 seasons of play-by-play data, having allowed 9.6 fewer points per 100 possessions than the league average (112.5).


The Thunder continue to have the highest opponent turnover rate (18.8 per 100 possessions) in the last 26 seasons. But they now also have the league’s lowest turnover rate on offense (11.7 per 100), having committed just three in Indiana on Thursday, when they came back from 15 points down to remain undefeated (now 9-0) against the Eastern Conference.


The Thunder got a couple of big points in Indiana when Cason Wallace set a screen for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, rolled freely into the paint and dropped the ball off to Isaiah Hartenstein. According to Second Spectrum tracking, Gilgeous-Alexander leads the league for the second straight season in having ball screens set for him by guards, with his 503 ball screens from guards being 162 more than any other player has used.

The Thunder are two games into their first stretch of five games in seven days, though their rest-disadvantage win over Memphis on Sunday was also the start of a five-game homestand. With that win, they’re 9-4 against the other eight West teams with winning records, set to face the Wolves (8-5 within the top nine) for the first time on Tuesday.

The Knicks had a couple of close calls last week, but they’ve won seven straight games since losing in the Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals, and they’ve gained some separation as a top-three team in the East.
Three takeaways

Wins over the Spurs and Wizards last week were just the Knicks’ 10th and 11th clutch games of the season, with only two teams having played fewer. They continue to close games with all five starters on the floor, and their starting lineup has now played 136 more minutes (539) than any other lineup in the league. There are only 32 players who’ve played at least 1,000 minutes this season, and the Knicks have five of them. (No other team has more than three.)


Jalen Brunson scored 16 of the Knicks’ 24 clutch points in Washington on Saturday, and his clutch usage rate of 46.3% would be the highest rate for any player in the last six seasons. Over his three seasons with the Knicks (including playoffs), he’s shot 98-for-186 (53%) on clutch 2-pointers, but just 21-for-70 (30%) on clutch 3s.


Through Thanksgiving, the Knicks were 1-7 when they lost the first quarter. Since Thanksgiving, they’re 5-1 after losing the first, with their win in Washington on Saturday improving them to 5-8 in games they trailed by double-digits. For the season, they’ve been the league’s best third-quarter team (plus 18.9 points per 100 possessions) by a healthy margin.

The Knicks will close 2024 with a second straight game in Washington. Their first game of 2025 (a visit from the Jazz) will be the end of a stretch where they will have played 14 of 16 games against teams that rank in the bottom 10 offensively. They’ll have a rest advantage when they begin a two-game trip in Oklahoma City on Friday, the first of two meetings with the Thunder in eight days.

The Celtics are in a bit of a slump, having lost four of their last six games, which hasn’t been a particularly tough stretch regarding the opponents.
Three takeaways

Losses to the Sixers and Pacers last week were just the fifth and sixth times that the Celtics have allowed more than 120 points per 100 possessions. They’ve seen more slippage on defense than on offense this season, though that can be partially attributed to Kristaps Porzingis playing less than half as much (19% of the Celtics’ total minutes) as he did last season (43%).


After turning his ankle, Porzingis missed the second half of the Christmas loss to Philly and both of the Celtics’ weekend games against the Pacers. Jrue Holiday (shoulder injury) missed all three games and the Celtics have still had all six of their top guys (the starters plus Al Horford) just three times this season. They’ve allowed 105.1 points per 100 possessions in 537 minutes with Holiday and Derrick White on the floor together, but 113.7 per 100 in 788 total minutes with one on the floor without the other.


The Celtics still rank second in opponent free throw rate, but the losses to the Sixers and Pacers were just the second and third times they’ve been outscored by double-digits from the line. Al Horford shot 1-for-10 from 3-point range on Sunday while also committing five fouls for the first time since the 2023 playoffs.

After hosting the Raptors on Tuesday, the Celtics will have played 29 of their 33 games within the Eastern Conference. They’ll begin 2025 with a tough, four-game trip that includes visits to the third-place Rockets and the three teams — Minnesota, Oklahoma City and Denver — that finished at the top of the West last season.

Ja Morant is out again (though we don’t know for how long), having suffered a right shoulder injury in New Orleans on Friday. That spoiled the first matchup between the first and second-place teams in the Western Conference, and the Grizzlies lost by 24 (their worst loss of the season) in Oklahoma City on Sunday night.
Three takeaways

With the loss to the Thunder, the Grizzlies have the worst record (3-8) in games played between the nine West teams that are currently over .500, having scored just 109.4 points per 100 possessions over those 11 games. That record breaks down to 2-4 with Morant and 1-4 (105.6 scored per 100) without him.


The Grizzlies did get three games last week with their new starting lineup together. That lineup — Morant, Desmond Bane, Jaylen Wells, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Zach Edey — has somehow outscored opponents by 57 points in its 40 total minutes, having scored 137 points on 80 offensive possessions (147 per 100).


It’s helped that Bane’s shooting has picked up. After registering an effective field goal percentage of just 51.1% through his first 19 games, he’s at 64.9% over the last six. While his season-long mark (54.5%) is still the worst of his career, Bane is putting up career-high marks in both assist ratio and rebounding percentage.

The Grizzlies played 16 of their first 31 games against the Eastern Conference (going 13-3 in those interconference games), but they’re now two games into a stretch of 12 straight against the West (9-8). Their five-game trip continues on Tuesday with their first meeting against the struggling Suns.

Luka Dončić is out at least a month with a calf strain and, with a tough schedule ahead, it will be a challenge for the Mavs to remain in the top six in the West.
Three takeaways

Even with a loss in Portland over the weekend, the Mavs are 7-2 in games that Kyrie Irving has played without Dončić. The first loss (in Miami) was in overtime and the second (Saturday) was a rest-disadvantage game. Five of the seven wins have come against teams that are currently over .500 and another (Friday in Phoenix) knocked the Suns out of that group.


They also erased almost all of a 28-point deficit after Dončić was hurt against the Wolves on Christmas, but were unable to complete the comeback. It was a similar story in Portland on Saturday, when the Mavs cut a 21-point deficit down to five, and just couldn’t get the stops they needed. The Mavs have the league’s second-biggest differential between their record in non-clutch games (13-3) and their record in games that were within five in the last five minutes (7-9), and the nine clutch losses are already as many as they had all of last season (23-9).


Dereck Lively II has also missed the last two games and Naji Marshall will be suspended for three more after his altercation with Jusuf Nurkić on Friday. Lively has been critical on the defensive end of the floor and the loss on Saturday was the second time that Dallas allowed the Blazers’ 26th-ranked offense to score more than 120 points per 100 possessions.

The Mavs have two games left on their four-game trip and their visit to Sacramento on Monday will be the start of a stretch where they’re playing eight of 14 against teams that rank in the top 10 offensively.

The Rockets have dropped the first two games of a five-game homestand, blowing double-digit, second-half leads against the Wolves and Heat.
Three takeaways

The Rockets still rank as the league’s third-best first-quarter team (plus-15.9 points per 100 possessions) and have seven wire-to-wire victories (three more than every team but the Grizzlies) after picking up two last week. But their weekend losses were the fifth and sixth times that they’ve trailed after the first 12 minutes and they’re 1-5 in those games.


They still have a winning record (10-8) in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, but the Rockets scored just four points on 11 clutch possessions as they lost the two close games over the weekend. They still had a chance to win against Minnesota after blowing a 16-point lead with less than five minutes left on Friday, but Fred VanVleet missed a leaning 3 for the win after Alperen Sengun was doubled in the post. VanVleet (0-for-4), Sengun (0-for-3), Jabari Smith Jr. (0-for-3) and Jalen Green (0-for-1) are a combined 0-for-11 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime, with Dillon Brooks and Amen Thompson both 1-for-1.


Jalen Green continues to have the occasional big game (like 30 points in New Orleans on Thursday), but has now had an effective field goal percentage below 45% in 18 (56%) of the Rockets’ 32 games. His overall mark of 48.2% ranks 94th among 101 players with at least 300 field goal attempts, with VanVleet (47.1%) one of the seven guys behind him.

The Rockets have a couple of days off before beginning 2025 with the final three games of their five-game homestand. They were 2-10 against the Mavs over the previous three seasons, but got a wire-to-wire win in Dallas in October, with six guys scoring in double-figures. Game 2 of the season series on Wednesday.

The Wolves continue with their Jekyll-and-Hyde act. Just when things were looking bleak again, they won three straight games, with huge wins in Dallas and Houston included.
Three takeaways

The three wins have come by a total of nine points, with the Wolves allowing just 16 points on 19 clutch defensive possessions. Their 20 clutch games are just one behind Golden State’s league-leading total of 21, and they’re an even 10-10 in those games.


The winning streak has also come with an uptick on offense (115.4 points scored per 100 possessions), and the old Knicks have led the way. Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo have combined to average 41.7 points on an effective field goal percentage of 65% over the three games, and Randle is now registering his highest mark (53.9%) in the last six seasons.


Despite Randle’s improvement, the Wolves’ starting lineup has been outscored by 22 points in his 45 minutes over the winning streak, and it’s now just a plus-1.6 per 100 possessions over its 379 total minutes. But the Wolves have been at their best with Nickeil Alexander-Walker on the floor and the Minnesota bench ranks third in December, up from 14th prior.

The ups and downs can be tied to the Wolves having played a pretty brutal schedule since Thanksgiving, with each of their last 13 games against teams no worse than the 16-16 Spurs. But relief isn’t coming until after they face the Thunder and Celtics this week. Tuesday will bring their first of four meetings with Oklahoma City, against whom they split the season series last year.

Pat Riley said Thursday that the Heat aren’t trading Jimmy Butler, who’s been out for 10 days, with the Heat playing ugly and close games in his absence.
Three takeaways

The Heat and their opponents have combined to score just 107.6 points per 100 possessions over their last seven games, with Miami struggling to find a consistent source of offense beyond that of Tyler Herro. Terry Rozier continues to have his worst shooting season since his second year in the league, Jaime Jaquez Jr. has taken a step backward offensively, and Bam Adebayo has missed his last 13 3-point attempts.


With ugly offense on both ends of the floor and with the Heat playing at a pretty slow pace, six of their last seven games have been within five points in the last five minutes. The Heat have scored just 42 points on 50 clutch possessions over that stretch, but Herro now leads the league with five buckets to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime, having drained the game-winner in Orlando on Thursday.


The Heat’s 89 points on 96 possessions in that game were the least efficient performance for a winning team this season, topping their mark of 95 on 99 in Minnesota (when Nikola Jović had the game-winner) in early November. According to Synergy tracking, the Magic scored just 18 points on 31 possessions against Miami’s zone, and the Heat have now played twice as much zone (10.8 possessions per game) as any other team.

The Heat end 2024 with two days off and should get Butler back this week, but they begin 2025 with their second stretch of five games in seven days. The first four of those games are against teams with losing records and the first three are at home, but the most important is against the Pacers on Thursday when the Heat will be at a rest disadvantage.

They also came back from 21 points down (17 down with seven minutes left) to beat Brooklyn on Sunday, having lost Jalen Suggs to a wrist injury in the first half. It wasn’t a great defensive game overall, but they took the lead after holding the Nets to just two points on a stretch of 10 fourth-quarter possessions and became the second team (Chicago was the first) with two wins in games, they trailed by at least 20.


With that comeback, the Magic have been 17.8 points per 100 possessions better in the second halves of games (plus-11.6, best in the league) than they’ve been before halftime (minus-6.2, seventh worst). That’s the league’s biggest half-to-half differential (in either direction) by a wide margin and is entirely about defense: 113.7 allowed per 100 (19th) in the first half and just 98.8 allowed per 100 (best by a wide margin) in the second half.


Tristan da Silva had a rough night (0-for-5 shooting, four turnovers) against the Knicks on Friday, but had 18 points or more in the Magic’s other three games last week, draining the dagger corner 3 against Boston with less than 10 seconds left. He was aggressive against Miami on Thursday, looking a lot like Wagner when he attacked the basket.

The Magic are off for the last two days of 2024 and their win over the Nets began a stretch of four straight games against teams with losing records. They’re 16-3 (third best) against that group, including 14-1 since early November.

They’re still waiting on Kawhi Leonard, but the Clippers have won four of their last five games, with a signature victory in Memphis last Monday.
Three takeaways

The Clippers have held their opponent under 103 points per 100 possessions in all four of these recent wins. The Grizzlies are once again near the top of the league in points in the paint, but their 21-for-54 (38.9%) shooting in the paint against the Clips was their worst mark of the season.


Overall, the Clippers have seen the league’s fifth-biggest jump in opponent field goal percentage in the paint from last season. Opponents have shot 55% at the rim when Ivica Zubac has been there, up from 49.6% (best in the league) in ’23-24.


They’ve still seen the league’s third-biggest drop in points allowed per 100 possessions. The Clippers have seen the fourth-biggest jump in opponent turnover rate and the biggest jump in defensive rebounding percentage. While Zubac’s rim protection hasn’t been as good, his rebounding (on defense and overall) has been the best of his career.

If this is the week that Leonard makes his season debut, it won’t be on Monday, when the Clippers begin a three-game trip in New Orleans.

Since winning the Emirates NBA Cup, the Bucks have been without Damian Lillard and/or Giannis Antetokounmpo (both dealing with illnesses) for all five of their games. They managed to win two without either of them, but they’ve since dropped two straight, stalling their pre-Cup momentum.
Three takeaways

These five post-Cup games have been pretty ugly on both ends of the floor, with the Bucks and their opponents combining to score just 106.3 points per 100 possessions. AJ Green and Taurean Prince combined to shoot 49.3% from 3-point range before the Cup final, but are 10-for-43 (23%) over the five games since.


The defense has been much better with Bobby Portis (starting in place of Antetokounmpo) off the floor, and he made one of the most confounding blunders of the season on Thursday. With the Bucks down three, Portis got screened by Cam Johnson and stayed to double Ben Simmons (who hasn’t made a shot from outside the paint in almost two years) instead of switching on to Johnson, who promptly put the game away with an open 3-pointer (and a free throw).


The other end of the floor was also an issue, with the Bucks scoring just 11 points on 20 clutch possessions (with five turnovers and Portis shooting 0-for-3) as they lost close games to the Nets and Bulls. They have the same record in games that were within five in the last five minutes (8-7) as they do otherwise, but rank 27th in clutch offense (exactly one point scored per possession).

The Bucks will have a second straight day off before playing in Indiana on Tuesday. They’ve won nine of their last 11 games (not including the NBA Cup final) with both Lillard and Antetokounmpo, and the latter had a 37-point triple-double in their first meeting (a 12-point win) with the Pacers.

The Nuggets went 3-2 on their first stretch of five games in seven days, breaking out offensively against Detroit on Saturday. But they’ve slipped out of the top six in the West.
Three takeaways

The Nuggets’ loss to Cleveland on Friday was the second time that they’ve allowed more than 140 points per 100 possessions, something they didn’t do at all last season. They’ve now allowed 1.6 more per 100 than they did in 2023-24, with only the Pelicans having seen a bigger jump.


The defensive drop-off has been almost entirely about how effectively their opponents have shot. The Nuggets have seen the league’s fourth-biggest jump in opponent field goal percentage in the paint and its third-biggest jump in opponent 3-point rate. They’ve allowed 2.8 more 3-pointers per game than they did last season


With Jamal Murray (1) and Aaron Gordon (2) missing games last week, the Nuggets’ regular starters have played together in just 12 of their 30 games. And Denver is just 5-7 in those games, having lost in Phoenix with all five guys on Christmas. That game got away when Denver scored just three points (with Nikola Jokić on the floor) on its final 10 possessions of the third quarter.

The Nuggets have two single-game road trips on a stretch where they’re playing seven of nine at home. The first of the two is Monday in Utah, after which they’ll play 10 of their next 11 games against teams currently .500 or better.

The Hawks have followed a three-game losing streak with four straight wins, climbing back into the top five in the Eastern Conference.
Three takeaways

The winning streak has been the Hawks’ best stretch of offense this season (123.6 points scored per 100 possessions), with two of the games having come against teams — Minnesota and Miami — that rank in the top 10 defensively. Trae Young, De’Andre Hunter and Jalen Johnson have each averaged more than 22 points over the four games, combining for a true shooting percentage of 67.1%.


Hunter continues to be the most efficient of the three and is now averaging five more points per game (20.6) than he did last season (15.6), even though he’s playing fewer minutes (27.9 vs. 29.5). He’s registering career-high marks in both 3-point percentage (45.2%) and 3-point rate (46% of his shots), but also free throw percentage (87.6%) and free throw rate (38.4 attempts per 100 shots from the field), having gone 10-for-10 from the line in the Hawks’ comeback win in Chicago on Thursday.


They came back from 21 points down in that one, scoring 50 points in the fourth quarter, including 31 on their final 12 possessions. Most of that damage (32-9 in 6.3 minutes) came with their Hunter-instead-of-Risacher lineup, which has now outscored opponents by 16.5 points per 100 possessions in 97 minutes. It would have eclipsed the 100-minute mark over the weekend, but Dyson Daniels has missed the last two games with an illness.

Playing without Daniels in Toronto on Sunday, the Hawks were able to hold their opponent under a point per possession for the second time. That was the start of their longest road trip of the season (six games over 12 days), with the Western Conference portion beginning in Denver on Wednesday.

The Lakers have won five of their last six games, with the last two coming without one of their two stars. Anthony Davis missed almost all of their Christmas win at Golden State and LeBron James was out against the Kings on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The first three wins on this stretch were about defense, but the last two have been the first two times since Thanksgiving that the Lakers scored more than 120 points per 100 possessions. They’re now 11-1 when they’ve scored at least 116 per 100.


James had 31 points and 10 assists in the Christmas win over the Warriors, while Davis returned from his ankle injury to post 36, 15 and eight assists against the Kings. But the Lakers also got big games from each of their other three starters. Max Christie seems to be getting used to his starting role, with the last three games being the three highest-scoring games of his career (17, 16 and 16 points).


On Sunday, the Lakers acquired Dorian Finney-Smith without giving up a first-round pick. Finney-Smith gives them a much-needed two-way player with size, though thus far, the Lakers have been at their best with the guy they traded (D’Angelo Russell) or the guy Finney-Smith will take minutes from (Rui Hachimura) on the floor.

Finney-Smith could be available and the Lakers will have a rest advantage when they host the Cavs on Tuesday. The Cavs clobbered L.A. (and Bronny James scored his first career points) when the two teams met in Cleveland in October.

The Pacers played three straight games against the Thunder and Celtics (x 2) and got one win out of the three, withstanding a Boston comeback on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The loss in Boston (a rest-disadvantage game and by far the Pacers’ worst defensive game of the season) came without Andrew Nembhard, who returned on Sunday with 17 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in the win. The Pacers have won nine of the last 11 games in which Nembhard has played at least 20 minutes.


Their current starting lineup, with Bennedict Mathurin in place of Aaron Nesmith (who hasn’t played since Nov. 1) has outscored opponents by 14.8 points per 100 possessions, the best mark among the eight league-wide lineups that have played at least 200 minutes. It’s allowed less than a point per possession, keeping opponents off the free-throw line and off the offensive glass.


Over their two games in Boston, the Pacers were outscored by 57 points (117-60) from 3-point range. But on Sunday, they were a plus-10 from the free throw line (their best differential of the season) and a plus-20 inside the arc. After shooting a historically good 50.5% from mid-range last season, they were at just 36.5% through their first 22 games this year. But they’re at a league-best 67-for-129 (51.9%) over their last 11, with both of their point guards – Tyrese Haliburton and T.J. McConnell over 60% on more than 15 attempts.

The Pacers haven’t been over .500 since they were 1-0 and getting back will be tough with games against the Bucks and Heat in the next four days. After that, they’ll play three straight against teams with losing records.

After losing 12 of their previous 15 games and falling back to .500 for the first time, the Warriors got a desperately needed win over Phoenix on Saturday, coming back from nine points down with six minutes left.
Three takeaways

The difference between the Warriors that were 12-3 (plus-10.0 points per 100 possessions) and the Warriors that went 3-12 (minus-7.3) was about even on both ends of the floor. It was also about struggles down the stretch, with Golden State getting outscored by 43.3 points per 100 clutch possessions over those five weeks. With the narrow win over the Suns (in which Phoenix scored just five points on 12 clutch possessions), 18 of the Warriors’ last 21 games have been within five points in the last five minutes.


Dennis Schröder has shot just 18-for-63 (29%) in his six games with the Warriors, who have scored an anemic 94.2 points per 100 possessions in his 165 minutes on the floor. But he had seven of the Warriors’ 14 clutch points on Saturday, draining a second-chance 3-pointer for the lead, stripping the ball off Kevin Durant, and hitting two big free throws in the closing seconds.


Jonathan Kuminga continues to come off the bench, but scored 34 points in both games of the Warriors’ weekend back-to-back, with 59 of those 68 total points coming in the paint (40) or at the free throw line (19-for-26). Kuminga has still seen a big drop in efficiency from last season, but the Warriors have outscored their opponents by 10.3 points per 100 possessions in his 205 minutes on the floor with both Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.

The Warriors have three homestands of at least six games. The first (six games over 11 days) began with their win against the Suns on Saturday and includes rest-advantage games against the Sixers and Grizzlies this week.

The Sixers got their biggest win of the season on Christmas, they’re 9-3 since Thanksgiving, and they remain undefeated (4-0) when Tyrese Maxey, Paul George and Joel Embiid have all been available for all four quarters.
Three takeaways

The Sixers were outscored by 15 points in 26 minutes with Maxey, George and Embiid all on the floor in Boston on Christmas, and they’ve still scored just 103.2 points per 100 possessions in their 134 total minutes together. But bench minutes were terrific last week, with Philly outscoring the Spurs, Celtics and Jazz by 19.9 per 100 in 75 minutes with Guerschon Yabusele on the floor.


With their three wins last week, the Sixers have won their last five games that have been within five points in the last five minutes. And, even when Embiid and George have been on the floor, Maxey has been the man in the clutch. He’s scored 20 of the team’s 41 clutch points (on 7-for-11 shooting) over that stretch and is one of three players – Jimmy Butler and Nikola Jokić are the others – that have shot better than 50% on at least 25 clutch shots for the season.


With the narrow wins (and a blowout loss in Cleveland without Embiid), the Sixers have outscored their opponents by only 2.4 points per 100 possessions (12th best) over this 9-3 stretch since Thanksgiving. But that’s a huge improvement over their first 17 games (minus 8.5 per 100), with the bigger improvement having come on offense (112.7 vs. 105.4 scored per 100).

Wins over the Spurs and Jazz last week were the Sixers’ first two victories (after an 0-7 start) against the Western Conference. A couple of more victories out West will keep them climbing in the East, with Philly now just a half-game out of a Play-In spot.

The Spurs went 1-3 on a four-game trip, with all three losses being heartbreakers.
Three takeaways

On Monday in Philly, two straight Julian Champagnie turnovers turned a one-point lead into a five-point deficit. And in New York and Minnesota, the Spurs blew a pair of eight-point, fourth-quarter leads. They’ve still been much better after halftime (plus-5.0 points per 100 possessions) than they’ve been before (minus-7.9 per 100) and they still have a better record in clutch games (8-6) than they do otherwise (8-10).


The Spurs have now been 16.2 points per 100 possessions better with Chris Paul on the floor (plus-5.3) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-10.9). That’s his biggest on-off differential in the last eight seasons since he was tied for the league’s biggest differential (19.4 per 100) in his last season with the Clippers.


With Paul and Wembanyama often sitting together, the Spurs are trying to figure out what to do with their bench units. Zach Collins got five straight DNPs, first with Charles Bassey getting minutes as the backup five and then with the Spurs playing small-ball (Harrison Barnes or Jeremy Sochan at the five when Wembanyama sat) for a couple of games. Then, in Minnesota on Sunday, both Collins and Bassey got minutes off the bench. Nothing has worked, in part because Stephon Castle has seemingly hit the rookie wall after a strong start to the season.

The Spurs will have a rest advantage when they host the Clippers on Tuesday, with two days off following that. Then they’re back on the road for five of their next six, with the only exception being the second half of a home-and-home back-to-back (their first two meetings of the season) against the Nuggets.

The Suns were once 13-2 with Kevin Durant in uniform, but he’s been available as they’ve lost five of their last six games, getting outscored by 13.6 points per 100 possessions in his 220 minutes on the floor over that stretch.


Devin Booker has missed the last five and the Suns have now been outscored by 7.1 per 100 (having allowed 119.2 per 100) in 887 total minutes with only one of Booker and Durant on the floor. They’ve had all three of Booker, Durant and Bradley Beal available in just four of their last 22 games.


The Suns have only been outscored by 4.1 points per 100 possessions over this 6-14 stretch, but they’ve lost seven of their last 10 games that were within five points in the last five minutes. They’ve scored just 54 points on 62 clutch possessions (87.1 per 100), with Booker (1-for-12), Durant (0-for-2) and Beal (2-for-9) combining to shoot 3-for-23 on clutch shots, over that stretch.

The Suns have played just one game against the top three teams in the West and bring 2024 to a close with their first meeting with the Grizzlies. They’re just 2-7 (with seven straight losses) against the Eastern Conference, against which they’ll play 11 of their first 12 games of 2025.

Josh Giddey returned from a four-game absence, recorded his second triple-double of the season, and hit a huge corner 3-pointer as the Bulls ended a three-game losing streak with a clutch win over the Antetokounmpo-less Bucks.
Three takeaways

The win on Saturday was the first time in 17 games (since Nov. 18) that the Bulls had their entire starting lineup available (though they’ve had fewer than four of the five available only twice). The lineup has been outscored by 1.3 points per 100 possessions in its 154 minutes, though the Bulls have a winning record (7-6) when all five have been available and have been worse (minus-5.3 per 100) in 274 total minutes with Ayo Dosunmu (who’s missed the last two games) on the floor with four of the five.


That 3-pointer for the lead against the Bucks was from the left corner, where Giddey has shot 35-for-86 (41%) over the last two seasons. He’s 82-for-264 (31%) from elsewhere around the arc since the start of last season and overall, his 32.7% from 3-point range this season is down from 33.7% in ’23-24.


Before Thursday, the Bulls were at their best defensively (112 points allowed per 100 possessions) in the fourth quarter. And then they allowed the Hawks to score 50 points in the fourth, including an amazing 31 on their final 12 possessions to come back from 16 points down with less than six minutes left. The loss spoiled a game in which the Bulls shot 22-for-43 (51%) from 3-point range, and it ended a 111-game winning streak (going back to March of 2021) in games where they held a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter.

The Bulls are 5-3 (3-1 on the road) in games played between the eight Eastern Conference teams with losing records, set to visit Charlotte and Washington this week. Their previous wins over the Hornets and Wizards account for two of the five times they’ve held their opponent to a point per possession or less.

The Pistons are the first team to match its win total from last season (14-68), getting there by winning the first three games of a four-game trip out West.
Three takeaways

When you take the league average into account, the bigger improvement has been on offense. And the four-game trip was the Pistons’ best offensive stretch this season (120.6 points scored per 100 possessions). Cade Cunningham shot below 40%, but still averaged 24.5 points and 10.3 assists over the four games. Malik Beasley, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jaden Ivey combined to shoot 39-for-80 (49%) from 3-point range.


Cunningham leads the league with 4.3 assists on 3-pointers per game, which would be the second-highest average for any player in the last seven seasons. He’s accounted for 47.6 total points per game via his own scoring and assists, fifth in the league and up from 40.0 last season.


With the 3-1 trip, the Pistons are one of seven teams with a better record on the road (9-10) than they have at home (5-8). Beasley and Hardaway have combined for an effective field goal percentage of just 60.8% on the road and just 51.4% at Little Caesars Arena.

The Pistons will now play eight of their next 10 games at home, with their second stretch of five games in seven days beginning Friday with a visit from the Hornets (to whom they’ve lost twice). They’ll be at a rest disadvantage when they host the Wolves the following night.

The Kings had lost five straight and blew a 16-point, fourth-quarter lead to the Pistons on Thursday. But it was still a shock that they fired Mike Brown less than halfway through his third season in Sacramento.
Three takeaways

At the time that Brown was fired, the Kings were 13-18 with the point differential (plus-1.2 per game, ninth best in the West) of a team that was 17-14. And they ranked in the top 10 on one end of the floor or the other for what would be just the second time in the last 20 seasons.


The problem, of course, is that, while the Kings were 7-5 in games that weren’t close, they were (and remain) 6-13 in those that were within five points in the last five minutes. DeMar DeRozan and De’Aaron Fox have shot relatively well (combined 42-for-91, 46%) in the clutch, but the Kings rank 27th in clutch defense (118.3 points allowed per 100 possessions) and have often entered clutch time with a deficit.


There was no clutch time as the Kings lost their first game with Doug Christie running the show. The loss to the Lakers (who were without LeBron James) was Sacramento’s worst defensive game of the season (132 points allowed on 99 possessions).

That loss began a stretch where the Kings are playing six of seven games against teams with winning records, with the only exception being a visit from the improving Sixers on Wednesday.

The Nets have remained relatively competitive, but they traded another important veteran on Sunday, sending Dorian Finney-Smith and Shake Milton to the Lakers for D’Angelo Russell (expiring contract), Maxwell Lewis and three second-round picks.
Three takeaways

Two players have played more than 10 minutes this season, with the Nets having outscored their opponents (per 100 possessions) with them on the floor. Those two players are Finney-Smith and Dennis Schröder, who are both now employed by teams in the Western Conference. Brooklyn has been outscored by 11.9 points per 100 possessions in 324 minutes with Cam Johnson on the floor without Schröder or Finney-Smith.


Russell will allow the Nets to play pick-and-roll basketball again, something they lost when they traded Schröder, leaving Milton, Ben Simmons and Reece Beekman as their only point guards. Their ability to gain advantages offensively will also be helped by Cam Thomas, who returned from a 13-game absence on Sunday and scored 25 points in less than 25 minutes against the league’s third-ranked defense.


Alas, the departure of Finney-Smith (a big who could shoot) could mean more minutes of Simmons playing alongside either Nic Claxton or Day’Ron Sharpe, compromising the offensive spacing. That was the case for the final seven minutes in Orlando on Sunday, when the Nets blew a 17-point lead, scoring just four points (shooting 0-for-8 from the field and committing three turnovers) on their final 12 possessions.

The Nets now have 31 picks over the next seven drafts. The best of the 31 should be their own in 2025, though they’re still seventh in the upside-down standings, with none of the six teams ahead of them looking like they’re going to drop very far.

Last season, the Blazers were 7-46 (third worst) against the 18 teams that finished with winning records. With their win over the Mavs on Saturday, they’re 7-11 against the 16 teams currently over .500. There are three teams in that group (the Lakers, Bucks and Magic) who have only four wins against the others.


The last five games (which include wins over Denver and Dallas) have been the Blazers’ best stretch of offense this season (115.2 points scored per 100 possessions). Five guys have averaged at least 14 points over the five games, with Shaedon Sharpe leading the way with 23 per game on an effective field goal percentage of 62.5%. He’s still at just 30% from 3-point range for the season, but he made five 3-pointers for just the third time in his career in the Blazers’ win over Utah on Thursday.


The Blazers have still been outscored by 36 points over the 3-2 stretch, with the three wins having come by a total of eight and the two losses both by 20-plus. They still have a worse point differential than three teams — Charlotte, Toronto and Utah — with only seven wins.

The Blazers have played a league-low two inter-conference games, but will now play 11 of their next 17 against the East. That stretch starts with a visit from the Sixers on Monday.

After winning two straight games for the first time, the Jazz have lost three straight.
Three takeaways

All three losses were within five points in the last five minutes and the last five games have been the Jazz’s best defensive stretch of the season (113.2 points allowed per 100 possessions). Of course, that’s still worse than the league average (112.5 per 100), only one of the five opponents ranks in the top half of the league offensively, and the Jazz still rank last defensively (for the second straight season) by a healthy margin.


It’s also been a relatively good stretch offensively, with the Jazz shooting 42.4% from 3-point range over the five games. That includes 16-for-33 from Collin Sexton, who’s registering career-high marks for both 3-point percentage (43.6%) and 3-point rate (34.8% of his shots) this season.


The 3-point shooting could be better if the Jazz could gain more advantages offensively. According to Second Spectrum tracking, only 38% of their 3-point attempts, the league’s lowest rate, have been wide open.

The defensive improvement will be tested as the Jazz play their next two games against teams – Denver and New York – that rank in the top six offensively.

The Wizards got their second win over Charlotte in the span of eight days, but remain two games in the win column behind the Hornets and Raptors at the bottom of the Eastern Conference.
Three takeaways

The Wizards played fewer guys than the Knicks in their overtime loss on Saturday. They were without Kyle Kuzma (who’s now missed the last 12 games) and Jordan Poole, and they only went eight deep. Justin Champagnie played almost 45 minutes, scoring a career-high 31 points on an amazing 13-for-15 shooting. Champagnie has already played more minutes and scored more points than he did over the previous two seasons combined and his effective field goal percentage of 66.5% ranks second among non-centers with at least 75 field goal attempts.


Alex Sarr has scored in double-figures in all eight games he’s played this month. He’s got an effective field goal percentage of 54.5% in December, up from 42.9% through Nov. 30. The win over Charlotte on Thursday was his sixth game with at least three blocks, with the Wizards 3-3 in those games.


With their loss in Oklahoma City last Monday, the Wizards have dropped 12 straight games on the road, with 11 of those 12 losses having been by double-digits. Their last (and only) road win was (by two points in Atlanta) in October.

Their best chance at another road win will be Friday when the two last-place teams in the East and West begin a home-and-home set in New Orleans. Before that, the Wizards will try to end a seven-game losing streak to the Knicks, who they will host again on Monday night.

The Raptors are getting healthier, but they’ve lost 10 straight games, with the last two losses having both come by 29 points.
Three takeaways

The Raptors have dropped into the bottom five on defense by allowing more than 131 points per 100 possessions over their last three games. With the last two defeats having been of the wire-to-wire variety, they’ve played 130 minutes of basketball without holding a lead.


Immanuel Quickley remains out, but Bruce Brown made his season debut on Sunday, scoring 12 points in 19 minutes off the bench. Jakob Poeltl also returned from a four-game absence over which the Raptors got clobbered on the glass (rebounding percentage of just 41.8%). The starters’ minutes were not good in the loss to the Hawks, but Toronto has still been at its best (minus 3.4 points per 100 possessions) with Poeltl on the floor.


Through the Raptors’ first 22 games, Ochai Agbaji was 31-for-57 (54%) on corner 3-pointers, with the 31 makes just one behind Mikal Bridges for the league lead. Since then, Agbaji is just 5-for-23 (22%) from the corners. His overall 3-point percentage (41%) is still the best mark of his career by a wide margin and Agbaji is being asked to defend the opponents’ best scorer most nights.

The Raptors are just four games into a stretch where they’re playing 15 of 17 against teams that currently have winning records. One of the two exceptions is a visit on Tuesday from the Nets, who won the first meeting less than two weeks ago.

The Hornets have lost 15 of their last 16 games, with a seven-game losing streak that includes two losses to the Wizards.
Three takeaways

Their loss in Washington on Thursday was the first time that the Hornets had LaMelo Ball, Brandon Miller, Miles Bridges and Mark Williams all available for the entire night. Ball has now played as many games as he did all of last season (22), and the Hornets have been much better with him on the floor (minus-2.1 points per 100 possessions) than they were in ’23-24 (minus-8.4), with the bigger difference on defense.


Both Ball and Miller were unavailable on Saturday, when the Hornets fell to 1-8 without their starting point guard. They’ve scored just 100.2 points per 100 possessions in 427 total minutes with back-up point guard Vasilije Micić on the floor, and Bridges has shot just 14-for-45 (31%), including 2-for-21 from 3-point range, in the three games he’s played without Ball.


With the last two losses having been pretty ugly on both ends of the floor, the Hornets have climbed back out of the bottom 10 on defense. They rank as the league’s sixth most improved defensive team, having allowed 4.9 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season. They’ve done a better job protecting the paint and preventing corner 3-pointers.

With their second loss in Washington, the Hornets are 0-8 within the league’s worst division (the Southeast). But they’re 5-4 against the league’s best division (the Central), a mark that includes two wins (by a total of three points) against the Pistons. Meeting No. 3 is in Detroit on Friday, the start of a stretch where the Hornets are playing seven of eight on the road.

The Pelicans’ losing streak is at nine games and they didn’t hold a lead in either of their two losses last week.
Three takeaways

The wire-to-wire defeats (at home) to the Rockets and Grizzlies gave the Pels a league-high six losses in which they never held a lead. They’ve shot 2-for-24 from 3-point range over their last three first quarters.


Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson have now missed the last eight and 23 games, respectively. But Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum, Herb Jones and Trey Murphy III have all been available for each of the last 10, and the Pels have been outscored by 8.7 points per 100 possessions in their 175 minutes on the floor together over that stretch.


Murphy has been shooting better and has averaged 26.2 points on 50/40/90 shooting over the last five games. But Murray continues to struggle and his effective field goal percentage of 41.0% is the worst mark among 176 players with at least 200 field goal attempts. He’s seen big drop-offs from last season in the paint (career-low 43.8% vs. 52.9%) and from the outside (38.2% vs. career-high 52.8%).

The Pels will complete a five-game homestand with a visit from the Clippers on Monday. They’ve lost 14 straight on the road (after winning their road opener) and their visit to Miami two nights later will end a stretch of seven straight games against teams with winning records.

The Cavs aren’t slowing down. They’ve won eight of their last nine games, a stretch that includes wins over the Celtics, Nuggets and Bucks.
Three takeaways

The Cavs beat the Bucks by 23 (leading by as many as 36) in Milwaukee’s first game after capturing the NBA Cup. It was just the second time this season that Cleveland held its opponent under a point per possession. They rank no higher defensively than they did last season (seventh) and have seen much bigger improvement on the other end of the floor, but the Cavs have also improved defensively when you consider their drop in points allowed per 100 possessions (-2.6) vs. the league average (-2.2).


Defensive improvement has come with forcing more turnovers, and the Cavs have forced 18.3 per 100 possessions over their four-game winning streak. Thanks to the light schedule, Evan Mobley missed just one game after his ankle turn, returning as a defensive menace in Brooklyn on Monday. The Cavs have allowed just 96.3 points per 100 possessions in Mobley’s 225 minutes on the floor over this 8-1 stretch.


Max Strus made his season debut (off the bench) on Friday, when Isaac Okoro was out with a shoulder injury suffered earlier in the week. The Cavs played 10 guys (before garbage time) in the win over the Bucks, and eventually, Kenny Atkinson will need to make some tough choices with his rotation. The league’s second-ranked bench has been critical to this team’s success.

The Cavs have yet to play West of New Orleans but will begin a four-game, post-Christmas trip in Denver on Friday. They’ll play as many games against teams currently over .500 on that trip (four) as they’ve played in the last six weeks.

The Thunder lost the Emirates NBA Cup Championship game, but they won the Thursday-Saturday, Miami-Oklahoma City-Orlando round-robin, sweeping their Florida back-to-back.
Three takeaways

If you count the ugly NBA Cup loss to Milwaukee, the Thunder have scored less efficiently than the league average in each of their last four games. Jalen Williams had shot 29-for-76 (38%) over his previous four before scoring a season-high 33 points in Miami on Friday. For the season, Williams has seen a drop in efficiency with another big jump in usage rate (and a big jump in 3-point rate), registering career-low marks in 2-point percentage, 3-point percentage and free throw rate.


The Thunder are still getting it done with defense, holding their opponents to 101.4 points per 100 possessions over their seven-game winning streak (in games that count toward the regular-season standings). The Heat had a top-10 offense before Friday, but scored just a point per possession (turning the ball over 19 times), tied for their worst offensive performance at home.


The Thunder have three players — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Alex Caruso and Jalen Williams — who rank in the top seven in steals per game. Cason Wallace (5.1) and Kenrich Williams (4.3) are (with Caruso) in the top 20 in deflections per 36 minutes, and Isaiah Hartenstein tied his career high with four steals in Orlando on Thursday. Caruso and Hartenstein have played just 87 minutes together, but the Thunder have allowed just 98.4 points per 100 possessions in 664 total minutes with one or both on the floor.

A stretch where the Thunder will have played 12 of 15 games (including the NBA Cup final) on the road comes to an end in Charlotte on Saturday. But that’s the start of their first stretch of five games in seven days. They’ll be at a rest disadvantage when they host the second-place Grizzlies (their first meeting with Memphis) on Sunday night.

The Celtics split their home-and-home set with the Bulls last week, going cold from 3-point range, but dominating inside on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Bulls haven’t done so bad trying to match Boston from beyond the arc. In the first two games of the season series, the two teams combined for 105 and 108 3-point attempts, respectively, with the 108 on Thursday tied for the third-most combined attempts in NBA history. Each team won one of those two games by nine points, with the loss on Thursday being just the third time this season that the Celtics (14-for-56, 25%) were outscored from 3-point range (57-42).


The Celtics didn’t shoot much better from deep (15-for-45, 33%) two nights later, but outscored the Bulls by 24 points (50-26) in the restricted area in a 25-point win, turning 17 offensive rebounds into a season-high 25 second-chance points. That improved them to a league-best 9-5 when shooting worse than the league average (36.0%) from 3-point range.


The three games against the Bulls have been the three times this season that the Celtics have had all five of their starters and Al Horford. Their starting lineup (with Kristaps Porziņģis) has been outscored by 4.0 points per 100 possessions in its 85 total minutes.

This is the ninth straight year with the Celtics on the Christmas Day schedule, though their game against the Sixers on Wednesday will be just the fourth of their 38 Christmas games that have come at home.

The Grizzlies have won 12 of their last 14 games, a stretch that includes a 5-0 mark without Ja Morant after a wire-to-wire blowout in Atlanta on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies have the league’s top-ranked offense (120 points scored per 100 possessions) over this 12-2 stretch, with the context that eight of the 14 games have come against teams that rank in the bottom 12 defensively. They’ve had 12 guys play at least 75 minutes over the 14 games and all 12 have averaged at least 14.5 points per 36 minutes.


Jaren Jackson Jr. had just one of the Grizzlies’ franchise-record 27 3-pointers in their 51-point win over the Warriors on Thursday. But he’s been the team’s leading scorer (total points) by a wide margin over these last 14 games. This season, he’s registering a career-best effective field goal percentage of 57.1%, even though the percentage of his buckets that have been assisted (56.7%) is lower than it was last season (when he often wasn’t getting much help offensively). He’s shot 101-for-187 (54%) on 2-point shots outside the restricted area, by far the best mark of his career and up from 43.6% last season.


Zach Edey was back in the starting lineup for his second and third games back from a 12-game absence. The 51-point win came with Golden State shooting just 15-for-41 (37%) in the paint, and the Grizzlies have now allowed just 94.6 points per 100 possessions in 162 minutes with Jackson and Edey on the floor together.

The Grizzlies have played just two games against teams that rank in the top seven defensively. They’ll play two more this week, hosting the Clippers (sixth) on Monday and visiting the Thunder (first) in the second game of a five-game trip that takes them out West and into 2025.

The Mavs played two games against the Clippers without Luka Dončić last week, losing the one in which they were also without Kyrie Irving and winning the one with Irving in the lineup (even though he shot just 6-for-25).
Three takeaways

The Mavs are now 7-2 in games in which they’ve had only one of their two stars, 6-1 with only Irving and 1-1 with only Dončić. They’ve scored 119.5 points per 100 possessions over those nine games, with their win on Saturday just the seventh time this season that the Clippers’ sixth-ranked defense has allowed more than 115 per 100.


Quentin Grimes scored 20 points (on 7-for-8 shooting) off the bench on Saturday and is registering career-high marks in both points per 36 minutes (16.0) and effective field goal percentage (61.0%). That’s come with a career-best 42.3% from 3-point range but with a big drop in the percentage of his shots that have come from beyond the arc (from 73% last season to 58%). So he’s also doubled his free throw rate and has made more free throws in 26 games (35) than he did in 51 games last season (34).


Overall, the numbers haven’t been much different in 683 total minutes with only one of Dončić or Irving on the floor (118.1 points scored, plus-6.5 points per 100 possessions) than in 471 minutes with both playing (118.6, plus-8.9). And it’s best to have them both available so that the Mavs can have at least one on the floor for all 48 minutes.

Dončić is listed as questionable for the Mavs’ game against Portland on Monday. Their Christmas game against the Wolves will be the teams’ first meeting since Week 2 when Irving had his second-highest-scoring game of the season (35 points) in a six-point victory in Minnesota.

The Rockets took care of business against the Pelicans and Raptors last week, though they had to come back from 16 points down in Toronto.
Three takeaways

The win over New Orleans was easily the Rockets’ best offensive game of the season (133 points on 100 possessions). Their much bigger improvement from last season has been on defense, but when you take the league average into account, they’re slightly better on offense. This would be the first time in the last five seasons (since Mike D’Antoni was the coach) that they ranked in the top half of the league on that end of the floor.


Dillon Brooks totaled 53 points over the two wins, his second and third-highest-scoring games of the season. Amazingly, the first game with zero free-throw attempts and the second came with 14. For the second straight season, Brooks is registering the best true shooting percentage of his career, though that mark (55.7%) is still below the league average (57.4%).


With Tari Eason out, Jae’Sean Tate got some rare rotation minutes on Sunday. He was also used as a defensive sub when an 11-point, fourth-quarter lead was cut to three in the closing seconds. When the Raptors had a chance to tie, he forced a turnover to seal the win. Houston has won five of its last six games that were within five points in the last five minutes, having allowed just 49 points on 55 clutch defensive possessions over that stretch.

Every other team had at least one rest-advantage game before Thanksgiving and nine teams have had five already. The Rockets haven’t had a rest-advantage game yet, but they’ll have two on the five-game homestand that begins Friday, with the first coming Sunday against the Heat.

Karl-Anthony Towns had a pretty successful return to Minnesota, scoring 32 points (on 10-for-12 from the field), grabbing 20 rebounds and dishing out six assists as the Knicks handed the Wolves their worst loss of the season.
Three takeaways

It was also Minnesota’s worst defensive game (133 points allowed on 103 Knicks possessions) of the season. The Wolves had allowed just 92.8 per 100 over their previous seven games and got eviscerated by New York’s offense. There was a lot more ball movement compared to the Knicks’ previous six games and they recorded assists on 39 of their 50 field goals.


The Knicks’ defense has, seemingly, been much improved. They’ve allowed just 104.4 points per 100 possessions (third in the league) over their 10 games since Thanksgiving, down from 116.6 (24th) before then. But nine of those 10 games have come against teams that currently rank in the bottom 10 offensively, and the other was against the 19th-ranked Pistons. Amazingly, they still have six more games on a stretch of 16 straight against teams in the bottom half of the league on that end of the floor.


The Knicks are the only team that’s played just two back-to-backs thus far. They’ll have four in the next five weeks, though the second games of those back-to-backs are against Washington, Chicago, Detroit and Brooklyn. They haven’t been as good against bad teams as they were last season, just 12-6 against the 14 teams that are currently at or below .500.

Three takeaways

The story of the NBA Cup final was Oklahoma City shooting 5-for-32 from 3-point range, but the Thunder also shot just 17-for-39 (44%) in the paint, which would have been their second-worst paint performance of the season if the game counted toward regular-season stats. Even with that game not counting, the Bucks lead the league with nine games of holding their opponents below 50% in the paint.


Delon Wright was, seemingly, a nice offseason addition on a minimum contract. But he’s struggled offensively and didn’t see the floor in the first half in Cleveland on Friday, when the Bucks were playing without Damian Lillard and started AJ Green at point guard. Wright did start the second half (with his team already in a big hole) and the Bucks outscored the Cavs and Wizards by 26 points in his 34 minutes over the weekend.


Khris Middleton played both games of the back-to-back and got his first start (in his seventh game) of the season on Saturday, when the Bucks beat the Wizards without Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo, improving to 2-1 without the latter. They’ve won nine of their last 10 games against teams that are currently at or below .500, with the Washington win being the start of a stretch of eight straight games against that group.

The Bucks’ 1-6 start to the season included losses to both the Bulls and Nets, who they will face this week. This is the first year since 2017 that Milwaukee isn’t playing on Christmas.

The Magic, now without their four leading scorers, remain afloat after a miraculous comeback against the Heat on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Magic bench has been solid, but not as good as it was last season, when it ranked seventh, in part because the team’s stars were healthier. The most productive player off the bench has been Moe Wagner, who was lost to an ACL tear in the first quarter on Saturday. Cole Anthony, meanwhile, hasn’t shot well (effective field goal percentage of just 45% before the weekend) and has even been DNP’d a few times.


But it was the bench – the deep bench – that was on the floor for most of the fourth quarter on Saturday, when the Magic outscored the Heat, 37-8, to come back from 22 down at the start of the period and win by seven. It was the first win for any team this season (teams are otherwise 0-151) when trailing by at least 20 points in the fourth and the first win for the Magic when trailing by 20-plus in the fourth since Nov. 19, 1997. Anthony (the 11th Magic player to see the floor) had 13 points, four rebounds and four assists in the final period, finishing with 35, eight and nine. Trevelin Queen (the 12th man) played more in the fourth quarter (11:52) than he had played through the Magic’s first 29 games (6:32).


So the Magic are 2-3 (all five games decided by single-digits) since losing Franz Wagner to injury. That’s great considering the strength of the schedule, and it’s kept them six games over .500 overall. The offense hasn’t really fallen off (it didn’t have far to fall anyway), and the other end of the floor (111.3 points allowed per 100 possessions over the five games) is still better-than-average defense against five teams that rank no worse than 12th offensively.

The Magic have four games left on their seven-game homestand and three left on a stretch of eight straight against teams with winning records. They’re 0-4 within the top five in the East, set to face the Celtics for the first time on Monday.

It hasn’t been easy, but the Nuggets have won four of their last five games to stay in the top five in the West.
Three takeaways

The Nuggets trailed by double-digits in the fourth quarter in all three of their games last week and erased each of those deficits. They lost at the buzzer in Portland on Thursday but got the comeback wins in Sacramento and New Orleans. Jamal Murray hit the game-winner against the Kings with 8.6 seconds left and sent the game against the Pelicans to overtime with another jumper with 8.8 seconds left. He and Nikola Jokić (both 4-for-8) are two of the four players with a league-high four buckets to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or OT.


The last two of those comebacks began with Jokić off the floor. DeAndre Jordan has been in the rotation for the last six games and Denver has been outscored by just 1.5 points per 100 possessions in his 65 minutes over that stretch, with even better numbers when Peyton Watson (who had a pair of incredible blocks in the fourth quarter on Sunday) has been out there with him.


Russell Westbrook gave up the game-winner on Thursday, allowing Anfernee Simons to drive right and then reaching for the ball instead of making him try to score over him. But Westbrook continues to be on the floor down the stretch of the Nuggets’ close games, and the Nuggets have outscored their opponents by 73 points (22.4 per 100 possessions) in 135 total minutes with him on the floor with Jokić and three of the other four starters.

Having just completed a stretch where they played 12 of 16 games on the road, the Nuggets will be home for eight of their next 11. But their win in New Orleans on Sunday was the start of their first stretch of five games in seven days, and they’ll be at a rest disadvantage against Phoenix on Monday night.

After losing by 51 points in Memphis on Thursday, the Warriors got a much-needed win in Minnesota, with Stephen Curry providing the heroics after they blew a 21-point lead.
Three takeaways

With the Warriors up two with less than four minutes left on Saturday, Curry outscored the Wolves, 11-2, by himself over the next 90 seconds. He’s averaged just 20.5 points per 36 minutes (on an effective field goal percentage of 52.7%) before halftime, but 32.6 per 36 (on 60.9%) after halftime this season.


With that, the Warriors have scored just 105.3 points per 100 possessions (28th) in first halves, but 118.8 (sixth) in second halves. That’s the biggest league’s half-to-half differential on offense.


Dennis Schröder shot just 5-for-20 (including 0-for-8) from 3-point range over his first two games with his new team, with the Warriors scoring just 86 points on 108 possessions (79.6 per 100) in his 50 minutes. Very little went right in Memphis, but Brandin Podziemski had his highest-scoring game of the season (21 points on 9-for-13 shooting) and his minutes off the bench were critical two nights later in Minnesota.

The Warriors will play their next nine games in California, with eight of those at home. Stephen Curry has shot just 32% (including 23% from 3-point range) over 10 Christmas games, with the Warriors set to host the Lakers on Wednesday.

The Wolves’ run of great defense came to an end last week when they lost a big game narratives-wise and standings-wise.
Three takeaways

After allowing 92.8 points per 100 possessions over their previous seven games, the Wolves allowed 123 per 100 over their two losses last week, with their loss to Karl-Anthony Towns’ Knicks on Thursday being their worst defensive game of the season.


They’re still the only team that ranks in the top five regarding both opponent 3-point percentage (34%, fourth) and the (lowest) percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come from 3-point range (40.8%, fourth), but that latter rate has been climbing over the last few weeks. The two losses last week were just the seventh and eighth times they’ve been outscored from beyond the arc and they’re now 1-7 in those games.


Mike Conley shot just 2-for-11 over the two games and now has an effective field goal percentage of just 46.2%, down from a career-best 59.5% last season. That’s the biggest drop-off among 227 players with at least 200 field goal attempts in 2023-24 and at least 100 in ’24-25.

Conley has shot much more effectively on the road (52.4%) than he has at the Target Center (40.6%), and the Wolves will play seven of their next 10 games on the road. That includes their first Christmas game (in Dallas) since 2017.

The Heat have followed a four-game winning streak with three straight losses, blowing a 25-point lead in Orlando on Saturday.
Three takeaways

It was a week of runs. On Monday in Detroit, the Heat forced overtime with a 26-7 run to close regulation and then scored the first eight points of the extra period … only for Tim Hardaway Jr. to make three straight 3-pointers. Tyler Herro had drained a contested 3 to force OT and now leads the league with three 3-pointers to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime. But he missed two for the lead in the final minute of the extra period.


The Heat didn’t have a chance to tie or take the lead in the final minute in Orlando on Saturday, when (playing without Jimmy Butler) they scored just eight points on 24 fourth-quarter possessions, blowing a 22-point lead at the start of the period. That’s tied for the least efficient quarter for any team in any game in the last three seasons (since April 8, 2022). Overall, the three-game losing streak has been the Heat’s worst three-game stretch of offense (107.4 points scored per 100 possessions) this season.


Most of the Heat’s fourth-quarter run in Detroit came with Butler at the four. For the season, the Heat have outscored their opponents by 67 points (scoring 132 points per 100 possessions) in about 90 total minutes with Butler and Bam Adebayo on the floor without one of their nominal power forwards (Haywood Highsmith, Nikola Jović, Jaime Jaquez Jr. or Kevin Love).

Including their loss to the Thunder on Friday (when he left with an illness after the first quarter), the Heat are 2-6 when Butler hasn’t been available or when he’s played fewer than 10 minutes. He’s listed as questionable for their game against Brooklyn on Monday.

The Clippers remain afloat and Kawhi Leonard just might make his season debut this week.
Three takeaways

The Clippers’ win over the Jazz’s 30th-ranked defense last Monday was their best offensive performance of the season (144 points on 103 possessions), and James Harden led the way with 41 points on 11-for-17 from the field and 12-for-14 at the line. After registering a usage rate of just 20.2% last season, Harden is at 30.2% this season, with that being his highest rate in the last five seasons (since his last full season in Houston). Of course, his efficiency has taken a big hit and that was just the fifth time (in 28 total games) that he made at least half of his shots from the field.


The Clippers split two games in Dallas last week, taking advantage of the absences of both Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving on Thursday. With Irving back two nights later, the score was tied early in the second quarter. But the Mavs outscored LA by 14 points over the next 11 minutes and never led by less than five after that. The Clippers are now 13-2 when they’ve led at the half and 1-11 when they’ve trailed at the half, with that being the league’s biggest such differential.


They’ve generally been a comeback team, holding the league’s second-best record (70-139, .335) when trailing by double-digits over the previous five seasons. But they’re just 2-12 (seventh-worst) with a double-digit deficit this season.

The Clippers are just two games into a stretch where they’re playing eight of 10 on the road. One of the lone home games is against the Warriors on Friday, which might be when Leonard suits up for the first time. The Clippers are 2-0 against Golden State, even though they’ve scored just 104.4 points per 100 possessions over the two games.

The Lakers have won three straight (and four of their last five) games to climb into the top six in the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

The Lakers rank last offensively since Thanksgiving, but as has been the case for most of the Anthony Davis era in L.A., when they win, they win with defense. The last five games have been, by far, their best stretch of defense (99.2 points allowed per 100 possessions) this season. The first two games were against bad offenses, but the last three have come against teams – the Grizzlies and Kings (x 2) – that rank in the top 10 on that end of the floor.


They’ve benefited from those opponents shooting less than 30% from 3-point range over the five games. But the Lakers have also been better on the defensive glass, grabbing 73.4% of available defensive boards, up from 69.5% (25th in the league) prior. Overall, the Lakers have still seen the league’s third-biggest drop in defensive rebounding percentage from last season.


The three-game winning streak coincides with a change in the starting lineup, with the new lineup (Max Christie with the Lakers’ four full-time starters) having outscored opponents by 24 points (allowing just 88 per 100) in 51 total minutes over the three games.

LeBron James is 10-8 all-time on Christmas, and this will be his fifth Christmas game (he’s 2-2) against Golden State, as well as the first Lakers-Warriors meeting of the season. The Warriors won three of the four meetings last season when no team scored more efficiently (126.2 points per 100 possessions) against L.A.

The Spurs have won four of their last five games to climb back into the Play-In Tournament group in the West.
Three takeaways

Victor Wembanyama had a pair of huge games last week, totaling 72 points and 14 blocks as the Spurs beat the Hawks and Blazers. After scoring at least 20 points in just three of his first nine games this season, he’s done so in 13 of his last 14. More than half of his shots (147/285) have come from 3-point range over that stretch, but his free throw rate (24.6 attempts per 100 shots from the field) is the same as it was over the first nine.


Devin Vassell got his first two starts of the season last week, scoring 23 points (shooting 5-for-7 from 3-point range) against Atlanta on Thursday. The Spurs’ new lineup — Chris Paul, Vassell, Harrison Barnes, Jeremy Sochan and Wembanyama — outscored the opponents by 16 points in 25 total minutes over the two games, though Keldon Johnson was on the floor (instead of Barnes) down the stretch of the overtime win over the Hawks.


That win improved the Spurs to 8-3 (second best) in games that were within five points in the last five minutes. With Wembanyama hitting the go-ahead 3 on Thursday, they’re 18-for-38 (47%) on clutch 3s and have seen the league’s biggest jump in clutch winning percentage from last season (13-28, third worst). The flip side of that is that they’re one of three teams — the Lakers and Suns are the others — with a winning record (overall) and a negative point differential.

The Spurs are the only team that hasn’t played in the Eastern time zone, but they’ll begin a four-game trip in Philadelphia on Monday and are playing 12 of their next 16 games outside of San Antonio. Wembanyama will make his Christmas debut at Madison Square Garden, where he shot just 4-for-14 in the Spurs’ visit last season

A three-game losing streak has dropped the Hawks below .500, leaving the Eastern Conference with just five teams with winning records.
Three takeaways

The Hawks beat the Celtics in their first game without Trae Young (Nov. 12 in Boston), but got clobbered by the Grizzlies (no Ja Morant) without Young on Saturday. Dyson Daniels continues to lead the league in steals by a wide margin, but has also been responsible for a bunch of turnovers on the other side of the floor of late. He’s committed 15 over the last five games, including five of the Hawks’ 25 turnovers on Saturday.


Those last five games have been the Hawks’ worst stretch of offense (104.3 points scored per 100 possessions) this season. The loss without Young wasn’t their worst offensive game in that stretch, but they’ve scored just 94 per 100 in his 97 total minutes off the floor over the last five.


The Hawks have been outscored from 3-point range in each of the last five games and in a league-high 24 (83%) of their 29 games thus far. They were outscored from beyond the arc in just 37 (45%) of their 82 games last season.

A visit from the Wolves on Monday will be the end of a stretch of eight straight games against teams with winning records, and the Hawks’ game against the Heat over the weekend (their first meeting with Miami) could be for sixth place in the East.

The Pacers have won four straight games and the defensive numbers just keep getting better.
Three takeaways

The winning streak has been, by a healthy margin, the Pacers’ best stretch of defense (104.8 points allowed per 100 possessions) this season. The last two wins have come against teams — Phoenix and Sacramento — that rank in the top 10 offensively. With another good defensive game or two, Indiana will likely climb out of the bottom 10 on that end of the floor.


The Pacers have still seen the league’s biggest jump from last season in the percentage of their opponents’ shots (41%) that have come from 3-point range. But that rate is just 35% during the win streak, with the Pacers outscoring their opponents by double-digits from beyond the arc in all four games. That’s as many times as they did in their first 25.


It’s also been the Pacers’ best four-game stretch of offense since early November. Seven Pacers have averaged double-figures and they’ve recorded assists on 76% of their field goals over the four games.

Nine of the Pacers’ last 13 games have come against teams that currently rank in the bottom 10 defensively. They’ll now play four straight against teams that rank in the top 10 on that end of the floor, and they’ll be at a rest disadvantage twice this week.

The Suns were 13-2 with Kevin Durant in uniform before Thursday, but doubled that loss total in the span of three days, falling to the Pacers and Pistons at home.
Three takeaways

The Suns have the second-best record (12-6) in games played within the Western Conference but are now 2-7 (with seven straight losses) against the East. Five of those seven losses have come at home and three of them – all against East teams currently below .500 – have come with Durant in the lineup.


Durant totaled 80 points on an effective field goal percentage of 61% over the two losses last week. All five Suns with more than 10 field goal attempts over the two games shot better than 50%. But Devin Booker wasn’t one of those five, leaving the loss to Indiana (just the Suns’ 11th game with Booker, Durant and Bradley Beal) with groin soreness and missing the loss to Detroit.


The Suns also allowed almost 123 points per 100 possessions over the two games. They’ve now slid to 24th in defensive efficiency, with Mike Budenholzer having had just one worse-than-average defense in his previous 10 seasons as a head coach. The defense has been at its worst (118.4 allowed per 100) with Beal on the floor.

Booker will be out again when the Suns visit the Nuggets with a rest advantage on Monday. The Suns themselves are just 1-4 (with four straight losses) in the second games of back-to-backs, set to play a tough, home-road back-to-back (vs. Dallas, at Golden State) this weekend.

The Kings are 0-4 on a five-game homestand that concludes on Thursday, suddenly four games in the loss column out of the Play-In Tournament.
Three takeaways

There are 13 teams currently under .500. The Kings are the only one that’s prioritizing this season (they traded for 35-year-old DeMar DeRozan in the summer) and haven’t had major injury issues.


Of course, while the Kings have seen the league’s fourth-biggest drop in winning percentage, they’ve only been 0.2 points per 100 possessions worse than they were last season. The 27-point loss to Indiana on Sunday was the Kings’ worst margin of defeat, and they still have a positive point differential for the season. Their record (13-17, .433) would be the worst in NBA history for a team that outscored its opponents by at least one point per game.


They’ve played a league-high 18 games that were within five points in the last five minutes and, with three narrow losses last week, are just 6-12 in those games. Teaming DeRozan with De’Aaron Fox was supposed to give them an edge in close games and the Kings rank sixth in clutch offense, but only the Raptors have been worse in games that were within five in the last five.

Entering this season, the Kings had won eight of their last nine (including five straight) games against the Lakers. But after two losses at home last week, they’re 0-3 vs. L.A. this season. They’ll finish the season series on Saturday, the Kings lone road game in a stretch where they’re playing eight of nine at the Golden 1 Center.

The Bulls won three straight games for the first time and split their home-and-home set with the Celtics, giving them wins against four of the top five teams in the East.
Three takeaways

On Thursday, the Bulls and Celtics combined for 108 3-point attempts, tied for the third most in the 46 seasons of the 3-point line. With the Bulls shooting 19-for-52 (37%), it was just the third time (the first time in a loss) that Boston has been outscored from beyond the arc, but the 11th time that Chicago had taken more than half of its shots from 3-point range. It had done so nine times in the first 45 seasons of the 3-point line.


With the 3-point volume down for both teams on Saturday, the Celtics were a plus-22 (60-38) in the paint. The Bulls have now been outscored by 9.9 points in the paint per game, which would be the biggest discrepancy for any team in the last 12 seasons.


Lonzo Ball has now played in six straight games, and he logged a season-high 23 minutes in the Bulls’ win in Toronto last Monday, draining a big, pull-up 3 to put Chicago up six with a little more than a minute left. He’s still just 20-for-64 (31%) from the field and, even with Josh Giddey out the last two games, has played only seven total minutes with the other four starters all on the floor.

The Pistons lost at home to the Jazz (somehow allowing 48 points in the first quarter) on Thursday, but began a four-game trip with a big win in Phoenix over the weekend.
Three takeaways

The Pistons are now just two wins from being the first team to match its total from last season (14-68). They rank as the league’s fourth most improved team regarding winning percentage and its third most improved team regarding point differential per 100 possessions (+6.1).


When you take the league average into account, the bigger improvement has been on offense, where the Pistons ranked 27th last season. Malik Beasley (16.4 points in just 28.6 minutes per game) has been a big addition and, while Tobias Harris and Tim Hardaway Jr. haven’t been nearly as prolific, having three capable vets around Cade Cunningham has been critical. Cunningham’s scoring has gone down on a per-minute basis, but he’s gone from averaging 8.1 to 9.7 assists per 36.


Hardaway had one of the best moments of the season (for anybody) in the Pistons’ win over the Heat last Monday, draining 3-pointers on three straight possessions to turn an eight-point deficit into a one-point lead in overtime. The Pistons have, amazingly, alternated wins and losses in their last 14 games that were within five points in the last five minutes, with their seven clutch wins just one shy of their total from last season (league-worst 8-27).

Matching last season’s win total this week will be tough with the last three games of the trip coming against the Lakers, Kings and Nuggets. The Pistons did beat L.A. in early November behind a triple-double from Cunningham and 26 points from Jaden Ivey.

The Sixers went 6-2 in their first eight games after Thanksgiving, though five of those six wins came against the Pistons, Hornets (x 3) and Bulls. They played in Cleveland (without Joel Embiid) on Saturday and lost by 27.
Three takeaways

With their two wins over Charlotte last week, the Sixers continue to have the best record (8-3) in games played between the nine Eastern Conference teams currently below .500. They’re 1-14 against everybody else, with the bigger difference having come on defense.


The Cavs’ 126 points on just 96 possessions (131 per 100) was Philly’s worst defensive performance of the season. The Sixers are 9-4 (with six straight wins) when they’ve allowed fewer points per 100 than the league average (112.4) and 0-13 when they’ve allowed more.


Embiid didn’t play on Saturday because it was the second game of a back-to-back. He had 34 points (with improved shooting from outside the paint) and nine assists against Charlotte on Friday when the Sixers improved to 2-0 in games that Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey have all been available for all four quarters. The offense has been bad, but they’ve allowed just 88.4 points per 100 possessions in 71 total minutes with all three on the floor.

The Nets got a win in Toronto on Thursday, but are still just 2-7 (only the Wizards have been worse statistically) since Thanksgiving.
Three takeaways

The post-Thanksgiving slide has been entirely about offense: 115.5 points scored per 100 possessions (eighth) before Thanksgiving, 104.3 (28th) since. A lot of that is 3-point shooting, but the Nets have also seen a big jump in turnover rate. They committed 20 turnovers per 100 possessions as they went 1-2 in their first three games since trading Dennis Schröder.


They even had more turnovers than the Jazz (who have the worst turnover rate for any team in the last 19 seasons) on Saturday. Ben Simmons recorded his first double-double (15 points and 10 assists) since January but had six of the team’s 19 turnovers as the Nets scored just 94 points on 101 possessions against the league’s worst defense.


With Schröder gone, Simmons has been starting at point guard, with the Nets getting outscored by 33 points in his 48 minutes alongside Nic Claxton over these last three games. The offense struggling in those minutes is not a surprise, but the Nets also allowed 130 points on 99 defensive possessions with that duo on the floor last week.

The Nets will play five of their next six games on the road, with two games in Milwaukee over that stretch. They’ve scored just 99.3 points per 100 possessions over three losses to the Magic, who they’ll visit on Sunday.

The Jazz have won two straight games for the first time, gaining some separation from the Pelicans at the bottom of the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

With the two wins coming in Detroit and Brooklyn, the Jazz are 4-1 against the Eastern Conference, with four of those five games having been on the road. They were 15-15 (starting 12-5) against the East last season, so they have as many wins over the last two seasons against the East (19-16) as they do against the West (19-55). That’s the league’s biggest own-vs.-opposite-conference discrepancy.


The win on Saturday came without Keyonte George (ankle sprain). The Jazz are now 2-0 without George, with the two wins (at San Antonio and at Brooklyn) accounting for two of the five times they’ve allowed fewer than 108 points per 100 possessions. In total, they’ve allowed 14.6 fewer points per 100 possessions with George off the floor (109.6) than they have with him on the floor (124.2), with that being the second-biggest differential among all players who’ve played at least 200 minutes.


Not coincidentally, the Jazz have committed fewer turnovers than their opponent in both of their games without George. They’ve committed fewer turnovers than their opponent in zero of the 25 games that George has played.

These two wins were the start of the stretch where the Jazz are playing 11 of 14 against the East, but they’ll face their toughest Eastern Conference test when they visit the Cavs on Monday.

The Raptors have lost seven straight games for the second time this season.
Three takeaways

Five of the last seven games have been within five points in the last five minutes, but the Raptors haven’t been able to close, scoring just 24 points on 28 clutch possessions over that stretch. They have the point differential of a team that’s 10-19 but are a league-worst 4-12 in games that were within five in the last five.


Jakob Poeltl has missed the last two games with a groin injury, and the Raptors have started rookie Jonathan Mogbo in his place. They’ve been at their best offensively (112.7 points scored per 100 possessions) with Poeltl on the floor, but have scored just 107 points on 126 possessions (85 per 100) with Scottie Barnes and/or RJ Barrett on the floor and Mogbo as the lone big.


That’s certainly not all Mogbo’s fault. Barnes has shot just 37% and has just 11 total free throw attempts over the five games he’s played during the losing streak. Fortunately, his 2-for-15 performance on Sunday was overshadowed by rookie Ja’Kobe Walter scoring a career-high 27 points, including all 14 of the Raptors’ points in the first four-plus minutes.

One of these last five clutch losses came (in Toronto) at the hands of the Knicks two weeks ago. The Raptors will be at a rest disadvantage in New York on Monday, 0-4 in rest-disadvantage games thus far.

The Blazers put an end to a six-game losing streak with Anfernee Simons’ buzzer-beating game-winner against the Nuggets on Thursday, but followed one of their best offensive games of the season with one of their worst.
Three takeaways

Matisse Thybulle remains out and plus-minus star Delano Banton missed their loss to the Spurs on Saturday, but the Blazers were otherwise healthy last week. Their most recent starting lineup (when everybody by Thybulle is available) eclipsed the 100-minute mark on Saturday, but has been outscored by 25.7 points per 100 possessions. That’s the worst mark by a wide margin among the 35 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes, with the second worst mark (minus-17.2 per 100) belonging to the Blazers’ previous lineup (Deni Avdija instead of Shaedon Sharpe).


With everybody available, Robert Williams III and Donovan Clingan played 18 minutes together over the Blazers’ two games last week, and Portland was plus-9 in those 18 minutes, scoring 55 points on just 35 offensive possessions.


Nine of those 55 came on second chances and the Blazers outscored the Nuggets by 13 (21-8) on second-chance points in the two-point win on Thursday. Portland ranks last in defensive rebounding percentage, but is sixth in offensive rebounding percentage, with Clingan ranking third among 340 players who’ve averaged at least 10 minutes per game. Two other rookies — Zach Edey and Yves Missi — are also in the top six.

The Blazers’ second best offensive game of the season game in a six-point loss to the Mavs earlier this month. They’ll face Dallas again two more times this week and will have a rest advantage in Portland on Saturday.

The Hornets continue to deal with injuries and went 1-4 on a stretch of five straight games within the bottom eight in the East.
Three takeaways

LaMelo Ball returned from a seven-game absence last Monday, but in the Hornets’ first game with Ball and Mark Williams both in uniform, they lost Brandon Miller to a left ankle injury. They’ve played 110 games since the start of last season and have had Ball, Miller, Miles Bridges and Williams on the floor together in just six of the 110, and for a total of just 65 minutes.


Ball had one of the more remarkable lines you’ll see in the Hornets’ loss in Washington on Thursday. He had 13 assists (with just one turnover), while also taking 34 shots in less than 34 minutes. He’s had a usage rate of at least 40% in 10 of his 20 games, having done so in just two of his 186 games before this season. The Hornets are 4-3 when Ball has had a usage rate below 35%.


The Hornets have shot just 24% from 3-point range over their four-game losing streak, with all seven guys with at least 10 attempts having shot worse than 30%. That includes Bridges shooting 3-for-25 (12%) from beyond the arc over the four games.

The Hornets have lost seven straight at home and will get visits from the league’s top two defenses this week. In between, they’ll visit Washington for the second straight Thursday.

The Pelicans were one stop or one shot away from a win on Sunday, but have lost seven straight games and are the first team to fall 20 games under .500.
Three takeaways

Rookie Yves Missi has now started 23 (including the last 12) games and had one of his best performances against the best player in the world on Sunday. He had 21 points, nine rebounds, two steals and three blocks in the loss to the Nuggets on Sunday when the Nuggets scored just 85 points on 89 possessions in his 40 minutes on the floor. The highlight was an emphatic block of Nikola Jokić in overtime, giving the Pelicans a chance to tie in the final minute.


The offense continues to be a struggle. The Pelicans’ loss to the Knicks on Saturday gave them more games of scoring less than a point per possession (7) than they had all of last season (6). They’ve scored 10.2 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did in 2023-24, which would be the fourth biggest year-to-year drop-off in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data.


The Pelicans have played the league’s second toughest schedule in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage and they’re halfway through a stretch of six straight games against teams that currently have winning records. They’re 2-16 (with five straight losses) against that group thus far.

With Trey Murphy III having turned his ankle in the second half on Sunday, the Pelicans have another three-day break before facing the Rockets for the second time in eight days, Game 3 of their five-game homestand (longest of the season).

The Wizards got their fourth win of the season on Thursday, surviving a huge shooting-opportunity discrepancy to beat the Hornets.
Three takeaways

The Wizards’ veterans finally won them a game. They trailed the Hornets by seven late in the third quarter but then went on a 15-0 run spanning the third and fourth, with Malcolm Brogdon, Corey Kispert and Jonas Valančiūnas on the floor for that entire run. Those three guys have played just 54 total minutes together (just 10 with Kyle Kuzma, who’s missed the last nine games), with the Wizards having outscored their opponents by 8.0 points per 100 possessions in that time.


Valančiūnas and Alex Sarr haven’t played together in the last five games that both have been available, so the rookie has played almost exclusively at the five of late. The Wizards have been outscored by an amazing 60 points in 83 total minutes on the floor with Sarr on the floor with either Valančiūnas or Marvin Bagley III.


Though their schedule has remained pretty tough, the Wizards have cut their point differential from -16.9 (through Dec. 6) to -14.7 points per game. That keeps them from having the worst differential in NBA history (-15.2, 1992-93 Mavs), and the schedule will get easier.

The Wizards will host the Hornets again this week, but their schedule doesn’t start to soften until the new year. They’re 1-17 against the 16 teams that currently have winning records, playing three of their next four against the Thunder and Knicks.

The Thunder have won five straight games (all by double-digits) and are heading to the NBA Cup final, making it clear that they have the league’s No. 1 defense on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Over the previous 28 seasons for which we have play-by-play data, the best defense belonged to the 2003-04 San Antonio Spurs, who allowed 8.3 fewer points per 100 possessions than the league average. The Thunder have been much better than that, allowing 9.4 fewer than the league average. The context is that they’ve played a relatively easy schedule regarding opposing offenses and have had a rest advantage in two of their six games against teams that currently rank in the top 10 offensively.


With the win over the Rockets on Saturday, the Thunder have held their opponent under a point per possession 11 times, two more times than any other team and almost as many times as they did all of last season (13). Going back to April of 2022, the Thunder have won their last 37 games in which they’ve allowed less than a point per possession.


Thunder opponents have taken 44.6% of their shots from 3-point range, the league’s third-highest opponent rate. They could be vulnerable against the Bucks, who rank third in 3-point percentage (38.9%). The percentage of OKC opponent 3-pointers that have been wide open (50%) is a little below the league average.

With their wins over the Mavs and Rockets last week, the Thunder have the best record (11-4) in games played between the 17 teams currently over .500. The Bucks are tied for the third worst (4-8), though they won the one head-to-head meeting last season in which Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard were available.

Playing without Evan Mobley on Friday, the Cavs handled their business against the Wizards, maintaining their one-game advantage in the loss column over the Celtics.
Three takeaways

According to Second Spectrum tracking, that win over Washington was just the fourth time this season that the Cavs shot less effectively than expected (given the quality of their shots). That’s the fewest such games for any team, and overall, only the Knicks have overshot their expected affected field goal percentage more than the Cavs this season.


The first three times where the Cavs shot less effectively than expected, they lost. But they had 18 more shooting opportunities than the Wizards on Friday, with the differential in free throw attempts (40-11) being the second biggest differential in any game this season. That differential took their season-long shooting-opportunity differential into the positive numbers, so they’re right in the middle of the pack regarding possession math.


Though they didn’t shoot well (30%) from 3-point range, 50 (55%) of the Cavs’ 91 field goal attempts came from beyond the arc, with that being their highest rate of the season. So they still outscored the Wizards (45-42) from deep and are now 16-0 (the Grizzlies are the only other undefeated team) when outscoring their opponent from 3-point range.

The Cavs won the possession math both nights as they swept their home-and-home series with the Bucks (by a total of just three points) in early November. They’ll host Milwaukee on Friday after another multi-day break.

Three takeaways

The Celtics were without Jayson Tatum against Detroit and without Al Horford (rest) on Sunday when Kristaps Porzingis left early with a foot issue. They’ve still had just one game where they had all of their top six guys (starters plus Horford) available.


In addition to destroying opponents from 3-point range, the Celtics also rank second (behind the Nuggets) in free throw differential, having outscored their opponents by 3.6 points per game at the line. They lead the league in opponent free throw rate (19.8 attempts per 100 shots from the field) for the second straight season, with Detroit and Washington totaling just 18 free throw attempts last week.


Payton Pritchard shot 12-for-25 from 3-point range over the two games, becoming the second player (Anthony Edwards was the first) with 100 made 3s this season. The Celtics have scored 121.9 points per 100 possessions with Pritchard on the floor, even though only 115 (15%) of his 745 minutes have come alongside both Tatum and Jaylen Brown.

The Mavs’ loss in Oklahoma City in the NBA Cup quarterfinals was their worst offensive performance (104 points on 100 possessions) of the season. Their win at Golden State on Sunday was their best (143 on 101).
Three takeaways

The Thunder took the ball out of Luka Dončić’s hands and he had more turnovers (six) than assists (five), while also shooting just 5-for-15 from the field. Oklahoma City can rotate out of two-on-the-ball situations better than most teams and overall, the Mavs have scored more efficiently when the opponent has used blitz or show coverage against Dončić (1.18 points per possession) than they have otherwise (0.99), according to Second Spectrum tracking.


The Warriors couldn’t take anything away, with Dončić scoring 45 points and assisting on another 34. That total (79 points scored or assisted on) is the highest for any player in a game this season, though just the ninth-highest of his career.


P.J. Washington missed the loss in Oklahoma City but returned on Sunday when the Mavs’ current starting lineup (with Dereck Lively II at the five) eclipsed the 100-minute mark. It was a plus-20 in the 10-point win at Golden State and has now outscored opponents by 22.5 points per 100 possessions, the best mark among the 29 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes.

Having traversed the country multiple times as they’ve played 13 of their last 17 games on the road, the Mavs will now have four days off. That is followed by a four-game homestand that begins with their first two meetings with the Clippers.

A 10-1 stretch took the Grizzlies into second place in the West and was capped by their first win (in three tries) against the Nets. But they came up empty offensively in L.A. on Sunday, falling to 0-3 in California.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies aren’t a jump-shooting team (in a relative sense), taking just 45% of their shots (the league’s fourth-lowest rate) from outside the paint. But they’ve still been rather inconsistent offensively, holding the league’s biggest differential in how effectively they’ve shot in wins (59.4%) vs. losses (49.0%). Ja Morant and Desmond Bane shot a combined 18-for-33 (55%) against Brooklyn but were 9-for-29 (31%) two nights later in L.A.


Zach Edey returned from a 12-game absence on Sunday and played almost twice as many minutes off the bench (24:20) as starting center Brandon Clarke (12:47). The Grizzlies still don’t have a lineup that’s played more than 82 minutes, because their current starting group (which has been playing together for more than a month) has averaged just 10.3 minutes per night together. The Grizzlies are getting 111.2 minutes per game from reserves, 83% more than the Knicks (60.9) and what would be the most for any team with a winning record in (at least) the last 43 seasons.


Though they scored just a point per possession, never led, and trailed by as many as 23 points on Sunday, the Grizzlies lost by only six. So while they’re in second place in the stronger conference, they continue to look better regarding point differential (that of a team that’s 21-6) than wins and losses. They’re the only team in the top five (or in the top seven) on both ends of the floor.

The first two of the Grizzlies’ California losses (the other was at Golden State) came in mid-November without Morant. Their second of four meetings with the Warriors is Thursday in Memphis, where the Grizzlies have won 11 of their last 12.

The Rockets scored less than a point per possession in both of their NBA Cup games last week but were able to win ugly against the Warriors before coming up short in Las Vegas.
Three takeaways

The Rockets were maybe fortunate to have Jalen Green sent to the line with a one-point deficit and 3.5 seconds left on Wednesday, but they also defended the Warriors’ ensuing inbounds play well. They seamlessly switched three straight back-screens and Jabari Smith Jr. reacted well to block Brandin Podziemski’s shot at the buzzer. Houston has won four of its last five games that were within five points in the last five minutes, having allowed just 47 points on 52 clutch possessions over that stretch.


Shooting remains an issue. The Rockets are the only team that ranks in the bottom 10 in field goal percentage in the paint (53.6%, 25th), mid-range field-goal percentage (38.5%, 22nd) and 3-point percentage (32.2%, 28th). The two Cup games last week were the 18th and 19th times they shot worse than expected based on the quality of their shots, according to Second Spectrum tracking. That total (19 games) leads the league.


Missed shots are rebound opportunities and the Rockets had 15 more offensive boards than the Thunder (19-4) on Saturday, winning the possession battle against the team with the best turnover differential in NBA history. They continue to lead the league in shooting opportunity differential (plus 5.8 per game).

The Rockets are just 6-2 against the 11 teams that currently have losing records but will play their next four games against that group. That stretch includes their first two meetings with the Pelicans.

The Knicks were the only home team to lose in the NBA Cup quarterfinals, but they responded with an important win in Orlando to climb past the Magic into third place in the Eastern Conference.
Three takeaways

The loss to the Hawks was the Knicks’ worst offensive performance of the season (100 points on 99 possessions), and may be a testament to how much their offense depends on Jalen Brunson (who was covered pretty well by Dyson Daniels). Though the Knicks added offensive talent in the summer, Brunson has seen a slight drop from last season in the percentage of his minutes on the floor in which he’s had possession of the ball (from 24.3% to 23.8%).


The loss was also the first time the Knicks lost (they were previously 12-0) after winning the first quarter. After holding the Hawks to 47 points on 53 possessions in the first half, they allowed 61 on only 47 after halftime. Overall, the Knicks are 6.0 points per 100 possessions better before halftime (plus-9.6) than they’ve been after (plus-3.6).


The Knicks played just eight guys in both of their wins last week, with the eighth guy (Cameron Payne) totaling less than 23 minutes over the two games. For the season, the Knicks have gotten an average of just 60.9 minutes per game from reserves, which would be the lowest mark for any team in the last 19 seasons and 10 minutes per game fewer than any other team this season (Denver is 29th at 71.0).

The Knicks are 3-3 against the Western Conference, with five of the six games coming on the road. They’ll visit the Wolves and Pelicans (who they beat by 33 points on Dec. 1) this week.

But 10 of the 15 games have been within five points in the last five minutes and they’ve won eight of those 10, having held their opponents to just 84 points on 95 clutch defensive possessions (88.4 per 100).


Khris Middleton has played no more than 23:08 in his four games back, but all four have been within five in the last five and he’s been on the floor down the stretch every time. The Bucks have been at their best with reserves on the floor over those four games. Middleton already has more assists to Giannis Antetokounmpo (15) in just 81 minutes together than everybody on the team except Damian Lillard (52).

Brook Lopez has the fifth-best rim-protection mark (opponents have shot just 51% when he’s been there) among 78 players who’ve defended at least 75 shots at the rim.

They’ve also climbed from 12th to fourth in defensive efficiency, having held their opponent under a point per possession in all six wins. The Wolves have been playing good teams, but none of the opponents currently rank higher than 14th offensively. heir game against the third-ranked Knicks on Thursday (with Karl-Anthony Towns making his return to Minnesota) will be a good test.


Amazingly, the Wolves rank 27th offensively over the 6-1 stretch, with Naz Reid, Mike Conley and Donte DiVincenzo all having shot below 40% on at least 45 field goal attempts. But the stifling defense has allowed them to survive some rough shooting nights. They had lost their first eight games in which they shot below 37% from 3-point range, but are 4-0 in those games this month.


The defense ranks first by wide margins in both opponent effective field goal percentage (46.8%) and opponent turnover rate (19.7 per 100 possessions) over the seven games. Over their two wins last week, the Wolves committed 15 fewer turnovers than the Lakers and Spurs.

Two nights after Towns visits, the Wolves will play an even bigger game against the Warriors (one of the two West teams with whom they’re currently tied at 14-11). The much bigger difference when they split two games at Golden State the week before last was on the Warriors’ end of the floor.

The Heat have won four straight after a comeback victory over the Raptors on Thursday.
Three takeaways

The Heat continue to have first-quarter issues and have won the opening period in just six of their 23 games. But they turned a 16-point deficit into a seven-point lead with a 33-10 run to close the first half on Thursday. It was their second win (they’re 2-8) in games they trailed by double-digits.


They would have been in a bigger hole if it weren’t for Duncan Robinson, who was doing everything — passing, cutting, rolling to the rim — but shooting 3-pointers in that first quarter on Thursday. Robinson has seen another jump in the percentage of his shots that have come inside the arc and the Heat offense has been at its best (117.7 points scored per 100 possessions) with him on the floor.


With Jimmy Butler in trade rumors, the Heat have won eight of the last 10 games he’s played in. They’ve been outscored by a single point (scoring just 107.9 per 100 possessions) in 267 total minutes with Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo on the floor without Butler.

The Heat have split two games against the Pistons, with the home team winning both by single digits and with Detroit having a 24-point advantage (36-12) on second chances over the two. The third meeting is Monday in Detroit.

The Magic were less than a minute from reaching the NBA Cup semifinals, but couldn’t close the deal in Milwaukee. Then, they fell to fourth place in the East with their first home loss of the season on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Magic scored relatively efficiently (112.6 points per 100 possessions) over their first two games without Franz Wagner. But their loss to the Knicks on Sunday was the seventh time they’ve scored less than a point per possession. They had just nine such games last season.


One bright spot on Sunday was Tristan da Silva, who scored a career-high 20 points, more than he had in his previous four games combined. The rookie has been a bit of a token starter (like Anthony Black last season) in the Magic’s makeshift lineups, but the latest lineup — with a frontline of da Silva, Wendell Carter Jr. and Goga Bitadze — has allowed less than a point per possession in its 48 minutes over the three games since Wagner’s injury.


The Magic have still played the league’s most road-heavy schedule (17 of 28 on the road), and they still have the league’s biggest home-road differentials regarding both winning percentage (10-1 vs. 7-10) and point differential per 100 possessions (plus-12.9 vs. minus-2.0).

Their loss to the Knicks was the start of the Magic’s longest homestand of the season, seven games over 16 days. But it’s a tough stretch regarding the strength of the opponents, with the first six games coming teams no worse than the 13-10 Heat.

The Nuggets have won two straight games for the first time in more than a month and are back in the top five in the West.
Three takeaways

Their win over the Clippers on Friday was just the ninth time the Nuggets had Jamal Murray (who returned from a two-game absence), Aaron Gordon and Nikola Jokić in the lineup. They’re still just 4-5 in those games, even though they’ve outscored their opponents by 10.9 points per 100 possessions in 226 total minutes with those three guys on the floor together.


The Nuggets don’t shoot a lot of threes (ranking last in 3-point rate by a healthy margin), but they can still dominate inside. They were plus-22 in the restricted area and plus-16 at the free throw line on Friday, even though Jokić had a relatively quiet night (16 points and two assists). For the season, only the Magic (plus-9.1) have outscored their opponents by more points per game than the Nuggets (plus-8.9) when you total restricted-area points and free throws.


The Nuggets’ bench no longer ranks last in the league. That distinction now belongs to the Jazz’s bench after Denver outscored the Hawks and Clippers by 13 points in 31 minutes with Jokić off the floor over these last two wins.

Two other benches in the bottom five are those of the Blazers and Pelicans, who the Nuggets will face on a three-game trip that begins in Sacramento on Monday.

The Warriors had a rough finish in the NBA Cup quarterfinals on Wednesday, fell into a huge hole against Dallas over the weekend, and have have lost eight of their last 10 games.
Three takeaways

The Warriors ranked 27th offensively over the first nine games of this 2-8 stretch. Then they broke out offensively on Sunday, shooting 27-for-54 from 3-point range and committing just 10 turnovers … and still lost to the Mavs by 10. The difference was at the free throw line (18-8), where the Warriors have one of the league’s six worst differentials (minus 3.4 points per game, 27th) for the fifth straight season.


Even with the shootout on Sunday, the Warriors have scored an anemic 89.8 points per 100 possessions in 216 minutes with Stephen Curry off the floor over the last 10 games. So they traded for Dennis Schröder on Sunday, hoping he can keep the offense somewhat afloat.


The question is how much the Warriors will change their offense to accommodate their new point guard. The Nets set 53.0 ball-screens per 100 possessions for Schröder, almost 10 more per 100 than the Warriors set for Chris Paul last season (43.5) and almost 70% more than they’ve set for Curry this year (31.7).

The Warriors’ slide began before they started playing some of the best teams in the league, but they have just two games left on a stretch of 10 straight against teams that currently have winning records, visiting the Grizzlies and Wolves after a three-day break.

The Hawks earned a trip to Las Vegas with an impressive comeback win in New York on Wednesday. But they didn’t have enough down the stretch against the Bucks over the weekend.
Three takeaways

Playing their NBA Cup elimination games against the teams that currently rank third and 11th offensively, the Hawks allowed just 102.9 points per 100 possessions. They rank sixth defensively since Thanksgiving, up from 22nd before the holiday. That’s mostly about opponent 3-point shooting (34.2% vs. 39.4%), but the Hawks have also been better on the defensive glass over these last eight games.


De’Andre Hunter shot just 5-for-16 in Vegas but is still the Hawks’ leading scorer (21.6 points per game) over their last nine games. Hunter hasn’t shot as well inside the arc as he did last season but has been on fire from beyond the arc (52% over the last nine).


The Hawks continue to close games with Hunter on the floor instead of Zaccharie Risacher. Their two lineups with Hunter in place of Risacher (and with either Clint Capela or Onyeka Okongwu at the five) have outscored opponents by 5.0 points per 100 possessions in 156 total minutes.

The Hawks’ schedule remains pretty tough for the next month or so. After playing in San Antonio on Thursday, they’ll begin a four-game homestand with pre-Christmas visits from the Grizzlies and Wolves.

Kevin Durant returned last week and (surprise!) the Suns won both of their games, climbing back into the top six in the West.
Three takeaways

The two wins came over the Jazz and Blazers — and by a total of just 15 points. The defense could have been better both nights, with the two bottom-10 offenses combining to score 121.8 points per 100 possessions against what is now a bottom-10 defense. Phoenix has now allowed 1.2 more points per 100 possessions than it did last season, with only the Pelicans and Nets having seen bigger jumps. (The league average has dropped by 2.1 per 100.)


Durant returned from a three-game absence, but Bradley Beal (knee swelling) missed both games. The Suns have had all three of their stars for just three of their last 16 games. While they’ve outscored their opponents by just 2.1 points per 100 possessions in 175 minutes with all three on the floor, they’re a plus-9.3 per 100 in 216 minutes with Durant and Devin Booker on the floor without Beal.


Tyus Jones totaled 38 points (shooting 8-for-10 from 3-point range) over the two weekend wins, while Jones, Booker and Durant also combined for 43 assists and just six turnovers. With Jones’ addition, the Suns have seen the league’s biggest drop in turnover rate from last season.

Their win over the Blazers on Sunday began a stretch where the Suns are playing five of six at home. That stretch will get tougher after they host the Pacers and Pistons this week, though the Suns have lost their last five games (including one with Durant) against the Eastern Conference.

The Clippers have lost three straight games, sliding from fifth to ninth place in the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

Their loss in Denver on Friday was the sixth time that the Clippers have scored less than a point per possession. They did so just three times all of last season. Overall, they’ve scored 8.2 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season, with only the Pelicans, Sixers and Pacers having seen bigger drop-offs.


The loss in Denver was also his second straight game in which James Harden had more turnovers (nine) than assists (six). In addition to registering the lowest effective field goal percentage of his career (46.7%), Harden has the second-highest turnover rate of his career (14.2 per 100 possessions used).


Kawhi Leonard appears to be getting closer to his season debut. Last season, Leonard was one of three players who played at least 1,000 minutes with their team at least five points per 100 possessions better on both offense and defense when they were on the floor (119.3, 111.1) than when they were off the floor (114.1, 117.9).

After hosting the Jazz on Monday, the Clippers will play eight of their next 10 games on the road, a stretch that begins with their first two games against the team — Dallas — that beat them in the first round of the 2024 playoffs. Their 36 meetings over the last five seasons (in which the Clippers were 20-16) were the most for any pair of Western Conference opponents over that stretch.

Having held on to edge the Pelicans on Thursday, the Kings have won three straight games to climb back to .500 for the first time since they were 8-8.
Three takeaways

The Kings are now 4-2 since moving Malik Monk into the starting lineup on Dec. 1. They have the league’s No. 1 offense over that stretch, with six players averaging at least 12.3 points and four averaging at least 3.7 assists.


The difference in the offense has been more about turnovers and rebounds than shooting. The Kings rank first in turnover rate and fifth in offensive rebounding percentage this month, up from 13th and 19th through November. Monk has an assist/turnover ratio of 41/8, while De’Aaron Fox is one of three starters with at least 13 offensive boards over the six games.


With fewer turnovers and more offensive boards, the Kings have averaged 9.4 more shooting opportunities than their opponents over the six games, having averaged 0.2 fewer through their first 20. Second-chance points were 21-10 in favor of the Kings in their two-point win in New Orleans.

The Kings are one of two teams — the Bulls are the other — with a winning record (7-6) on the road and a losing record (6-7) at home. They play eight of their next nine games at Golden 1 Center, which includes their final three games (two at home) against the Lakers (whom they lost in Week 1).

LeBron James returned from a two-game absence on Sunday and the Lakers got a quality, wire-to-wire (and much-needed) win over the Grizzlies.
Three takeaways

Before the win on Sunday, the Lakers had lost eight of their last 11 games. That slide was about the strength of schedule as much as anything else. The Lakers are 10-1 against the 13 teams currently at or below .500, but just 4-11 against the 17 teams that are currently over .500. That’s the league’s biggest such differential and all four wins against the good teams (two of them over Memphis) have been by seven points or less. Six of the 11 losses have come by 17 points or more.


While the Lakers’ biggest issues have been on defense, the bigger difference vs. the good teams has been on offense. They’ve scored just 106.1 points per 100 possessions over those 15 games against teams currently over .500, compared to 119.8 per 100 against everybody else. The win on Sunday was the Lakers’ fastest-paced game of the season and not all that efficient for either team. L.A. committed a season-high 23 turnovers and shot just 10-for-34 (29%) from 3-point range.


Sunday also brought another lineup change, with Max Christie starting alongside James, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and Anthony Davis for the first time. The other four guys (who’ve all started every game they’ve played in) have now played 237 total minutes over 15 games together. The Lakers are 9-6 in those games but have been outscored by 5.6 points per 100 possessions in those 237 minutes with all four on the floor.

James had a triple-double when the Lakers beat the Kings (who are currently on that .500 line) in Week 1. Their last three meetings with the Kings are in the next two weeks, with a two-game series in Sacramento beginning Thursday.

The Spurs remain just outside the Play-In Tournament group in the West, having split their two games last week.
Three takeaways

Having recorded 66 assists on their 81 field goals last week, the Spurs have an assist rate of 71.3%, the highest rate for any team in the last 21 seasons (topping their mark of 71.2% last season).


The Spurs’ lineup of Chris Paul, Stephon Castle, Julian Champagnie, Harrison Barnes and Victor Wembanyama has outscored opponents by 18.4 points per 100 possessions. That is the second-best mark among 15 lineups that have played at least 150 minutes. But when Castle returned from a one-game absence on Sunday, he came off the bench for the first time since Nov. 4, with Jeremy Sochan starting in his place. The Sochan lineup was good (plus-12 in 13.2 minutes), but bench minutes from Castle and Devin Vassell (who combined to shoot 3-for-19) were rough.


Vassell’s effective field goal percentage for the season (56.5%) is still the best mark of his career. But the Spurs have been outscored by a brutal 17.5 points per 100 possessions in his 271 minutes on the floor, and that number is even worse (minus 20.5 per 100 with anemic offense) in his 125 minutes alongside Wembanyama.

The Spurs are one of three teams — the Hornets and Blazers are the other — that have played just two games against the opposite conference. They’ll host the Hawks on Thursday, having lost both meetings with Atlanta last season.

The Pacers have losses to the Raptors, Nets and Hornets this month, but they may finally be trending in the right direction.
Three takeaways

The opponents haven’t been great; The Pacers’ last six (and 10 of their last 11) games have come against teams with losing records. But their two-weekend wins — over the Sixers and Pelicans — came with their two largest margins of victory this season (14 and 15 points). Ten days ago, they didn’t have a single win that wasn’t within five points in the last five minutes. Now, they have three.


The strength of the opponents (including three teams that rank in the bottom five offensively) is one reason why the last five games have been the Pacers’ best stretch of defense this season (109.0 points allowed per 100 possessions). But the Pacers themselves have had something to with it too. Philly and New Orleans combined to shoot just 46% in the paint, Obi Toppin had eight deflections over the two games, and Myles Turner had four blocks on Sunday.


Toppin had been the backup center before Sunday when the Pacers traded for Thomas Bryant. They needed another big body, but they haven’t been bad (plus-3.2 points per 100 possessions) in 239 minutes with a frontline of Toppin and Pascal Siakam. Improving in Turner’s minutes on the floor will be more important than what Bryant gives them going forward.

If the Pacers are indeed improving, we’re going to find out in the next few weeks. Their next nine games — a stretch bookended by games against the Suns — are all against teams currently at or above .500, with seven of those nine against teams that rank in the top 10 offensively. They’ll have a rest advantage in Sacramento on Sunday.

Joel Embiid is injured again, and he isn’t the only one. Embiid suffered a sinus fracture and Jared McCain tore the meniscus in his left knee in the Sixers’ loss to Indiana on Friday.
Three takeaways

Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey have played in three games together and in two of those three games, one of the three guys (George or Embiid) has been unavailable for the second half. They’ve played 45 minutes together total, with ugly offense on both ends of the floor (83.8 combined points scored per 100 possessions) in those 45 minutes.


Embiid and George were on the floor for all of the 14-0, first-quarter Indiana run that the Sixers never fully recovered from on Friday (Maxey was off for just two of those 14 points). They’ve lost the first quarter by at least nine points in five of their last eight games and are now 1-16 in games they’ve trailed by double-digits.


McCain will be missed. The Sixers’ offense has been much better with him on the floor and he would be the first rookie guard in the last 15 seasons to average at least 20 points per 36 minutes (minimum 500 total minutes) with an effective field goal percentage of 55% or higher.

The Sixers had won four of five before the loss to the Pacers, they still have the best record (6-3) in games played between the eight East teams currently below .500, and they’ll get two games against the Hornets this week. Embiid is listed as out for their game in Charlotte on Monday.

The Bulls are 1-2 on a stretch of four straight games against other East teams with losing records, picking up a relatively ugly win over the Hornets on Friday.
Three takeaways

The win over Charlotte was comfortable, despite the Bulls (playing without Nikola Vučević) scoring just 109 points on 105 possessions. It was just their second victory (the first was in October) in a game in which they’ve scored less than 118 per 100. They had 16 such victories last season, even though they had a bottom-10 defense overall.


The Bulls shot 27% from 3-point range and still outscored the Hornets by 18 points from beyond the arc, with the two teams combining to miss 75 3-pointers. The Bulls have taken more than half of their shots from 3-point range in five of their last six games and they’re about to play the Celtics twice this week. It should be noted that the record for combined 3-point attempts in a game is 111, set by the Bucks and Hawks (in an overtime game) in March of 2019. These two teams came six short of the record when the Celtics won in Chicago less than three weeks ago.


Lonzo Ball has played (106 total minutes) in six of the last seven games. He hasn’t shot well (38%), but has 20 assists, 10 steals (3.4 per 36) and just three turnovers over that stretch, with the Bulls scoring 118.7 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor.

The Bulls will finish this stretch within the bottom eight in the East with a visit to Toronto on Monday. Then they’ll play five straight games against the East’s top seven, with four of those five against the Celtics and Bucks.

The Nets have lost five of their last six games and just traded their most important player regarding their somewhat surprising start.
Three takeaways

The Nets made a trade with the Rockets in the summer to get their own 2025 first-round pick back, so it’s no surprise that they would lean into losing more games at some point. But they wasted no time in sending Dennis Schröder to the Warriors, doing so on the first day that the injured De’Anthony Melton (coming back with some second-round picks) was trade-eligible.


The Nets’ offense, which ranked in the top 10 just two weeks ago, has been at its best with Dorian Finney-Smith on the floor. But it’s scored just 107.1 points per 100 possessions in 102 minutes with Finney-Smith and Cam Johnson on the floor without Schröder.


Starting Ben Simmons at point guard (and assuming that Nic Claxton remains the starting center) would mean having two non-shooters on the floor. Simmons hasn’t made a shot from outside the paint since Feb. of 2023 and has played just 85 (19%) of his 447 minutes with Claxton or Day’Ron Sharpe.

The Pistons have lost four of their last five games, and they’ve lost 12 straight to the Celtics after getting clobbered in Boston on Thursday.
Three takeaways

It’s been a tough, five-game stretch, with four of the five against the Celtics (x 2), Bucks and Knicks. And it’s been the Pistons’ worst five-game stretch, both offensively (107.1 points scored per 100 possessions) and defensively (120.6 allowed per 100) this season.


Cade Cunningham has averaged 24.3 points (on an effective field goal percentage of 57%), 8.0 rebounds and 10.8 assists over the 1-4 stretch. But he missed the Pistons’ loss to the Sixers and the team has scored just 95.5 points per 100 possessions in his 102 total minutes off the floor in the last 16 days.


Jaden Ivey has shot a career-best 36.7% from 3-point range, but the Celtics were willing to let him to shoot on Thursday, going under screens and backing off him in transition. That 3-point percentage breaks down to 30-for-71 (42.3%) on catch-and-shoot attempts and 16-for-56 (28.6%) on pull-ups. That’s the fifth biggest differential among 48 players with at least 50 attempts of each, with Malik Beasley (44.7% vs. 33.8%) having the sixth biggest.

The Pistons and Heat have split their two meetings thus far, with Detroit winning at home last month when Erik Spoelstra called a timeout he didn’t have.

Still awaiting the return of Immanuel Quickley (who last played Nov. 10), the Raptors have lost Scottie Barnes again, this time to a badly sprained ankle suffered in their loss to the Knicks last Monday.
Three takeaways

With their loss in Miami on Thursday, the Raptors are 2-10 without Barnes, though they’ve been better offensively in those games (112.4 points scored per 100 possessions) than in the 14 he’s played (109.2). That difference has been about turnovers more than shooting and they did win the turnover battle (while shooting poorly) against the Heat.


The Raptors continue to rank last in both opponent free throw rate (30.6 attempts per 100 shots from the field) and free throw differential (minus-4.8 points per game). They were outscored by 10 points at the line in their 10-point loss on Thursday when Davion Mitchell fouled out in less than 21 minutes. Mitchell (4.0) and Jamal Shead (4.7) are two of the 13 guards who’ve played at least 300 minutes and committed at least four fouls per 36.


The Raptors erased an 11-point deficit against the Knicks on Monday, but couldn’t get the stop they needed in the final minute and remain one of three teams — the Pistons and Jazz are the others — that haven’t won a game they’ve trailed by double-digits (0-16).

The Raptors are back home for a three-game homestand this week, facing the Bulls, Nets and Rockets all for the first time. They’re currently 3-3 (3-1 at home) in games played between the eight East teams with losing records.

The Hornets are 1-1 in a stretch of five straight games (four on the road) within the bottom eight in the Eastern Conference, having lost an ugly one in Chicago on Friday.
Three takeaways

Over their first five games without LaMelo Ball, the Hornets scored just as efficiently (109.1 points per 100 possessions) as they did over their 18 games with him in uniform. But they scored just 95 on 105 possessions on Friday, their worst shooting night (8-for-46 from 3-point range) of the season. Overall, they’ve scored just 102.6 per 100 in 596 total minutes with Ball off the floor.


Mark Williams has played in four of the last five games and got his first start on Friday. He’s still played just 47 total minutes (in which the Hornets have been outscored by 38 points), but has averaged 28.1 points (on 68% shooting), 16.7 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per 36.


With Williams and Moussa Diabaté, the Hornets have two of the top five players in offensive rebounding percentage. They’ve outscored their opponents by 4.7 second-chance points per game, the league’s best differential.

The Hornets still have a winning record (5-4) in games played between the eight East teams that are currently below .500, and they’ve yet to face the last-place Wizards, who they’ll visit on Thursday.

The Jazz were competitive against the Suns on Friday, but they’ve lost 11 of their last 13 and remain tied in the win column with the last-place Pelicans.
Three takeaways

The loss on Friday was the second time in their last three games that the Jazz have scored more than 130 points per 100 possessions. Their 13 corner 3-pointers (including four from John Collins) against the Suns are tied for the fifth most for any team in any game (including playoffs) in the 29 seasons for which we have shot-location data. Jordan Clarkson returned from a seven-game absence and scored 23 points in less than 31 minutes off the bench.


Alas, it was also the second straight game in which the Jazz allowed more than 140 per 100 and the only time in NBA history that both teams made at least 22 3-pointers. Going back to last January, the Jazz have been the opponent in six of the last 20 regular-season games in which a team has scored more than 140 points per 100 possessions. Those two games (along with some not-so-terrible defense from the Wizards) has the Jazz last in defensive efficiency for what would be the second straight season.


The Suns are a potent offensive team (especially with Kevin Durant back in the lineup), but the Jazz defense was also pretty porous. There were several instances of miscommunication on switches and the Utah zone yielded open shots pretty easily.

The Jazz will play their next five games on the road, with three of the five against bottom-10 offenses and another — Saturday in Brooklyn — against a middle-of-the-pack offense that just lost its point guard.

The Blazers have been relatively competitive (no 40-point losses) over the last eight days, but they’ve dropped six straight games, becoming the sixth team that’s at least 10 games below .500.
Three takeaways

The Blazers’ top three centers — Deandre Ayton, Donovan Clingan and Robert Williams III — have all missed a bunch of games over the last several weeks. Jabari Walker started at the five against the Spurs on Friday, when the Blazers closed with a frontline of Deni Avdija and Jerami Grant. They’ve played 71 total minutes with Grant at the five (no Ayton, Clingan, Duop Reath, Walker or Williams on the floor), and have only been outscored by four points (with the Blazers and their opponents combining to scored 125 per 100 possessions) in those 71 minutes.


Avdija totaled 36 points on 13-for-20 shooting in the Blazers’ two games over the weekend. After registering an effective field goal percentage of just 39.3% through the Blazers’ first 13 games, he has a mark of 60.0% over the last 13.


With the younger guards that the Blazers need to develop, 25-year-old Dalano Banton is somewhat of an afterthought on this roster. But Banton has been playing regular minutes off the bench and the Blazers (who have the league’s fourth-worst point differential overall) have somehow outscored their opponents by 32 points in his 400 total minutes on the floor. The much bigger difference between his minutes on and off the floor has been on offense.

The Blazers have played just two games against the Eastern Conference, but still have five games left on a stretch of 12 straight against the West. Their first meeting of the season with the Nuggets (to whom they’ve lost seven straight) is Thursday in Portland.

Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson remain on the shelf, and the Pelicans have lost 19 of their last 21 games.
Three takeaways

The four healthy guys in the Pelicans’ top six – Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum, Herb Jones and Trey Murphy III – have still played only 82 total minutes together (over five games). But the Pels have also been outscored (by 1.6 points per 100 possessions) in those 82 minutes. So they’re not yet winning when they have their best (available) players on the floor.


Murray has an effective field goal percentage of 51.9% over his last five games, up from 31.8% over his first four games back from an extended absence. But he also had 16 turnovers over the Pels’ two losses last week, and that doesn’t count him getting stripped on his way up with the team down two in the final seconds against the Kings on Thursday.


The loss to the Kings dropped the Pels to 4-6 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, with four of the six losses having come at home. Overall, they’ve only been outscored by 4.8 points per game at Smoothie King Center, but their minus-17.6 per game on the road would be the worst road mark for any team in the last 32 seasons.

The Pels’ longest homestand of the season (five games over 10 days) begins Saturday, but their next seven games are against teams with winning records and they’ll be at a rest-disadvantage against the Nuggets on Sunday.

The Wizards got the Cavs and Celtics for their two extra games and actually brought their season-long point differential down, losing the two games by a total of just 24 points.
Three takeaways

The Wizards have actually had the league’s best defense vs. Boston, having allowed just 110.3 points per 100 possessions over three meetings. The defensive numbers weren’t too bad in Cleveland (or in their win against Denver the week before), and the Wizards have climbed out of the basement on that end of the floor. But they continue to get clobbered on the glass, having allowed their last five opponents to retain 35.7% of available offensive rebounds.


Bilal Coulibaly has averaged a team-high 21.0 points and 5.0 assists over the last three games (against three top-10 defenses), and only 11 of his 24 buckets over that stretch have been assisted. He’s averaged 2.7 minutes of possession (7.7% of his minutes on the floor) this season, up from 1.2 minutes (4.4%) last season.


The Wizards’ point differential (minus-15.8 points per game) is still the worst in NBA history, but only three of their 24 games have come against the other 10 teams that currently have losing records.

They’ve lost all three of those games (by 12 points or more), but they’ll play the shorthanded Hornets twice (at home) in the next two weeks, with the first meeting on Thursday.

Somebody break up the Washington Wizards!
After managing just two wins (both against the Atlanta Hawks) through their first 20 games, they've won two of their last five, including a huge upset over the visiting Denver Nuggets on December 7.
This surely doesn't mean Washington is in for some kind of dramatic turnaround, but a few solid team performances could help the team's future prospects.
Jordan Poole, specifically, was dynamic in both recent wins.
He had 39 points on 12-of-26 shooting against Denver, then he poured in another 27 on 15 shots in Thursday's win over the Charlotte Hornets.
If that's enough for one of the 29 other teams in the league to give the Wizards even a little value for Poole in a trade, the organization would have to be thrilled."

Lauri Markkanen and the Utah Jazz offered a bit of a reminder in Thursday's win over the Detroit Pistons.

Obviously, the result isn't some harbinger of a coming push toward the play-in tournament, but it might reassure Jazz fans looking forward to Markkanen playing for a more competitive team in future seasons or hoping for a good return in a Sexton trade."

Injuries completely derailed this 2024-25 campaign for the New Orleans Pelicans. And even as rotation players such as Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum and Trey Murphy III have started to filter back into the rotation, it's starting to feel like the momentum toward tanking is inescapable.
The Pelicans lost their fifth straight on Thursday. They have just one win since November 15. And they're in the West.
They're nine wins shy of the 10th-place team in that conference, but they're six behind 10th in the win column in the East.

But the Brooklyn Nets, who just made a rebuild-friendly trade that sent Dennis Schröder to the Golden State Warriors, have one of the most intriguing forwards potentially in the market in Cameron Johnson.
The 6'8"" forward just had 33 points in a win over the Toronto Raptors on Thursday. He's now averaging 19.2 points and 3.3 threes, while shooting 43.1 percent from deep.
His multipositional defense, low-maintenance offense and burgeoning playmaking ability (he's averaging 3.1 assists after registering six on Thursday) would make him a seamless fit with just about anyone."

As trade rumors swirl around Zach LaVine and Nikola Vučević, the Chicago Bulls have quietly won three in a row and five of their last seven.
On Thursday, they beat the reigning champions in Boston. And the Celtics had each of their top six players in action.
At the very least, the Bulls—at least as currently constructed—are solidifying themselves as 2025 play-in participants. But the organization still has to be asking itself whether that should even be the goal.
LaVine's scoring and playmaking should be more trade marketable than it was a few months ago. And Vučević's versatility as a shooter and passer at the 5 could have him in high demand between now and the trade deadline.
Either could dramatically impact playoff races. And getting both off of Chicago's roster would almost certainly improve the Bulls' shot to land a top pick in 2025."

The Sacramento Kings ended their week with back-to-back home losses to the Denver Nuggets and Los Angeles Lakers, and it's becoming increasingly clear that the team may have to address its glaring weakness before long.
On Thursday, the Kings made fewer threes than their opponents for the 17th time this season. For the entire campaign, they've made 76 fewer threes than their opponents (only two teams have deeper deficits).
And while some of that can be chalked up to shooting struggles from De'Aaron Fox, Kevin Huerter and Keegan Murray, the issue is as much philosophical as anything.
Sacramento leads, by a wide margin, the entire league in percentage of shots that come from the midrange."

After starting the season 8-1, the Phoenix Suns have tumbled down the standings over the last month and change.
And in their most recent loss, a home game against the sub-.500 Indiana Pacers, not even 37 points from Kevin Durant could save them.
We're just over a quarter into the season, but it's already become clear Phoenix (currently bottom-10 in the league in points allowed per 100 possessions) will need some defensive upgrades to be a bona fide contender.
The problem, of course, is that the organization already churned through just about all of its trade assets (it only controls one of its first-round picks between now and 2032) and Bradley Beal still has a no-trade clause."

The Orlando Magic are in for a tricky few weeks.
With their two best players and top two scorers, Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner, both recovering from torn obliques, offense has been (and will be) hard to come by.
In Thursday's home loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, rookie Tristan da Silva took a team-high 15 shots, and the team only mustered 99 points.
But the news wasn't all bad. Orlando won Da Silva's minutes by six points. And this opportunity for him to be a top option on offense could pay dividends later in the season, when Banchero and Wagner are back.
Experience is often the best teacher in basketball, and Da Silva is about to get a crash course in it."

The Atlanta Hawks rode a little hot streak all the way to the NBA Cup semifinals in Las Vegas, but they've come back to earth in their last few games.
They're 1-3 in their last four, with that lone win being the Cup quarterfinal against the New York Knicks.
And while there are plenty of potential reasons for the up-and-down nature of this Hawks campaign, it ultimately comes down to Trae Young.
Prior to this season, he averaged 25.5 points and 2.6 threes, while shooting 43.6 percent from the field and 35.5 percent from deep. After a relatively solid shooting night in Thursday's loss to the San Antonio Spurs (and 35 points in the Cup semifinal defeat to the Milwaukee Bucks), he's at 21.6 points and 2.6 threes, while shooting 39.0 percent from the field and 32.0 percent from deep.
Young's playmaking and distribution have been as good as they've ever been, but more consistency from the Hawks will require more shooting consistency from the 26-year-old."

The 126 points they surrendered was the second-most the Blazers have scored in a game all season.
In short, the Nuggets (outside of maybe Russell Westbrook and Christian Braun) simply don't appear to care all that much, particularly on defense. And as long as they keep moseying through games, the trade rumors are just going to get louder."

The biggest concern was likely on another row from the box score, though. Stephen Curry was minus-41 in the loss, making it (by far) the worst single-game plus-minus of his career.

The win in the championship game doesn't count toward the standings. The individual numbers from that contest aren't folded into regular-season averages.
But Giannis Antetokounmpo's performance in a blowout win over the Oklahoma City Thunder in Tuesday's final NBA Cup game could certainly leave an impression on fans and media members who love talking about the MVP.
During the action, Yahoo's Kevin O'Connor posted: ""Giannis should be the MVP favorite...""
The Ringer's Bill Simmons was in on the conversation, too: ""Giannis +600 for NBA MVP on Fan Duel right now. Seems high!""
And though Basketball Reference's MVP Tracker still has Giannis in third place and well behind runaway favorite Nikola Jokić, it's not hard to articulate the Bucks superstar's case.
He's averaging 32.7 points, 11.5 rebounds and 6.1 assists for one of the hottest teams in the NBA. And while he's not quite the defender he was five years ago, he's certainly more of a playmaker on that end than Jokić (even if a stark difference in impact is harder to find)."

With Morant's dynamic playmaking, Jaren Jackson Jr.'s scoring and rim protection and a wealth of competent role players (after those two, there are 10 players averaging between seven and 15 points), Memphis is one of the deepest, most athletic and most well-rounded teams in the NBA."

Thursday's victory wasn't quite as surprising, but there were some positive takeaways from that too. Chief among them may have been rookie Alexandre Sarr hitting three threes and blocking three shots.

Getting back into the play-in mix in the West feels almost impossible at this point. The injury bug won't leave them alone. Much of the rotation was out while Brandon Ingram tried to keep the season on track. When his teammates started filtering back into the rotation, he went down.
And, of course, expecting an extended stretch of basketball from Zion Williamson has become one of sports' least fruitful exercises.
Instead of hoping things magically come together and some kind of run puts the Pelicans within striking distance of 10th place, they should be shopping veterans such as Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum, Ingram and maybe even Williamson now.

They went 2-1 this week, overcoming a 22-point fourth-quarter deficit against the Miami Heat on Sunday and beating the reigning champion Boston Celtics two days later.
The Heat got them back on Thursday, but they had to scratch and claw for every second of that 89-88 affair. And it's become clear that regardless of who's available, Orlando will bring everything it has on the defensive end.
When Jalen Suggs or Tristan da Silva are hitting shots, it's enough to still surprise just about any opponent in the league."

The Los Angeles Lakers have to be feeling pretty good after Austin Reaves' late drive and score past Andrew Wiggins to beat the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day.
Yes, the season has been underwhelming. They're in the bottom 10 in net rating, and Anthony Davis had to leave the holiday game early with an ankle injury, but they do have reason to celebrate.
Despite the up-and-down nature of the campaign, they're in the West's top six. And Reaves is having a career year on one of the league's best contracts. He's averaging 17.4 points, 5.1 assists and 2.6 threes."

It took longer than expected, but the Atlanta Hawks are finally showing hints of their upside.
Surrounding Trae Young with rangy, mostly position-less three-and-D forwards was a smart move, and the philosophy is starting to translate into wins.
Atlanta is 9-4 in its last 13. The chemistry between Young and Jalen Johnson (the league's most prolific assist combo) is unmistakable. And the offensive ceiling when those two are on the floor is high.
Thursday, they combined for 57 points and 17 assists in a come-from-behind win that included a 50-point fourth quarter.

The Denver Nuggets are 5-2 in their last seven games, but all is not well for the 2023 champions.
One of the losses in that stretch came against the Portland Trail Blazers. They needed overtime to beat the injury-ravaged New Orleans Pelicans. They also lost to the Washington Wizards earlier this month.
And perhaps more concerning than the individual game results, after signing a max extension this past offseason, Jamal Murray looks less explosive than he has in the past, and his production hasn't been much better than Russell Westbrook (who's playing on a vet minimum).
This week alone, Denver blew out the Phoenix Suns in a game Murray missed and lost to them when he started. On the season, the Nuggets are 11-11 when the 27-year-old starts and 5-1 when he doesn't."

The Jimmy Butler noise got loud enough this week that Miami Heat president Pat Riley released a bold, public statement to refute reports that the star might be traded.
Statement from Pat Riley""We usually don't comment on rumors, but all this speculation has become a distraction to the team and is not fair to the players and coaches. Therefore, we will make it clear - We are not trading Jimmy Butler.""
Given the lack of a contract extension for Butler and the constant rumors on this front, it's hard to blame fans who are still open to the possibility of a move.
In the meantime, Butler's more available teammate, Tyler Herro, continues to play like a fringe All-Star.
Thursday, he drilled a game-winner to avenge a ""snatched defeat from the jaws of victory"" from earlier in the week against the Orlando Magic.

Back spasms for your best player are worth at least some mild concern. And that's what has kept Giannis Antetokounmpo out of action since December 20.

And for the entire season, Milwaukee's point differential per 100 possessions is actually a little better when its eight-time All-Star is off the floor.
Assuming this injury isn't something serious, the Bucks should be fine until Giannis returns, and their climb up the Eastern Conference standings will almost certainly continue."

The Boston Celtics are still the understandable favorites to win the 2025 NBA Finals, but they've looked a little closer to mortal of late.
They have dropped three of their last four. One loss came to the sub-.500 Chicago Bulls. The next was to an Orlando Magic squad without Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Moritz Wagner. And on Christmas Day, they failed to protect home court against Joel Embiid and Philadelphia 76ers.
Against Philly, the defense simply couldn't slow down Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, but falling short against Chicago and Orlando was the result of struggles on the other end.
The Celtics made fewer than 30 percent of their three-point attempts in both contests. And though it's hard to imagine that happening in four out of seven games against a single opponent, that's the risk of being as reliant on three-point shooting as Boston is.
If the triples dry up in a playoff series, someone will have an outside shot to eliminate the Celtics."

With the best offense in the league, a top-10 defense, four players playing like stars (Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley, Darius Garland and Evan Mobley) and a supporting cast that's looked better than it has at any other point in Cleveland's Mitchell era, the Cavs are real title threats."

He also made all seven of his free throws after taking just three total in his first three games -- a sign that he may be getting more comfortable playing through contact as he continues to ramp up his activity."

Now they're all injured. So it shouldn't be much of a surprise that Dallas is 2-8 over their last 10. Irving played through a disc issue in Tuesday's loss to Denver but did not look sharp, scoring 11 points in 30 minutes on 4-of-18 shooting."

The Spurs are 23rd in the NBA in 3-point accuracy, and percentage points away from being 28th. Only one player (Julian Champagnie) is shooting over 37% on reasonable volume.

You have to start wondering when they reach the point of no return, as the math isn't exactly in their favor. On the plus side, George is starting to look like the player Philadelphia hoped they'd signed, averaging 25 points, eight rebounds and six assists on 47/46/100 shooting splits during the latest losing streak."

OffRtg: 121.2 (1) DefRtg: 110.6 (9) NetRtg: +10.6 (2) Pace: 100.7 (6)
The Cavs won the first matchup between the two best teams in the league, scoring an efficient 129 points on 101 possessions against what remains the best defense in the 29 seasons of play-by-play data. Then, they had their worst offensive performance of 2024-25 against the Pacers.
Three takeaways

The Cavs shot well (15-for-36) from 3-point range on Wednesday, but were also able to dominate inside, with their 46 points in the restricted area being tied for the most that the Thunder have allowed this season. Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley had 30 (on 15-for-18 shooting) of those 46, and that doesn’t include the biggest bucket of the night when Mobley took Isaiah Hartenstein into the paint to put the Cavs up five with a little more than a minute left.


According to Synergy tracking, the 17 possessions of zone (on which the Thunder scored only 13 points) that the Cavs played on Wednesday was the second most zone they’ve played this season. They rank third with 5.7 possessions of zone per game and sixth in points allowed per zone possession (0.94) among the 14 teams that have played at least 75 possessions of zone this season.


The Cavs’ 12-game winning streak ended Sunday against the Pacers, when they blew a 15-point, third-quarter lead, scoring just 33 points on their final 47 possessions. Caris LeVert’s shooting (8-for-26 from 3-point range in January) may finally be regressing toward the mean.

The second half of the Cavs’ home-and-home series with Indiana is Tuesday and the start of a stretch where they’re playing five of six on the road. The other rematch is Thursday in Oklahoma City, where the Thunder have won nine straight.

The Thunder’s 15-game winning streak (in games that count toward the regular-season standings) came to an end in Cleveland on Wednesday, but they still have a huge lead at the top of the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

For the second straight season, the Thunder defense is yielding the most corner 3-point attempts in the league (11.0 per game), and the Cavs were 8-for-14 from the corners as they handed the Thunder their second-worst defensive performance of the season (129 points allowed on 101 possessions) on Wednesday.


Yielding corner 3s is the flip side of having an aggressive defense with the league’s highest opponent turnover rate by a wide margin. And most of the time, the Thunder force 3-point attempts that are rushed and/or from sub-par shooters. “We choose aggression,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said before his team responded with a thrashing of the Knicks on Friday. “And we really try to put teams in positions where they’re on our terms. I thought [vs.] Cleveland the other night, we played the game on their terms, and that’s why they were able to create so much rhythm. And that’s a credit to them.”


The Cavs also built a five-point lead with a minute to go with a 56-second possession in which the Thunder couldn’t get a rebound. Oklahoma City has a defensive rebounding percentage of 69.7% in wins and just 63.7% in losses, with that being the league’s second-biggest win-loss differential on the defensive glass.

The Thunder will try to defend on their terms when they face the Cavs again on Thursday. That’s the front end of a home-road back-to-back in which the opponents — Cleveland are Dallas — are two of the six teams Oklahoma City has lost to this season. The Thunder were much better on the glass when they beat the Mavs in the Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals with Isaiah Hartenstein than they were when they lost without him (and Chet Holmgren) back in November.

The Celtics continue to tread water and were fortunate to escape with a win over the Pelicans on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Through their first 35 games, the Celtics were outscored from 3-point range just four times. In their last four games, they’ve been outscored from 3-point range … four times. Three of those games have come against teams — Denver (30th), Sacramento (24th) and New Orleans (26th) — that rank in the bottom seven in 3-point rate.


The bigger difference has been on their end of the floor, with the last three games being just the eighth, ninth and 10th times, respectively, they’ve taken less than half of their shots from beyond the arc. They’ve also shot just 27% from deep over the four-game stretch, with Jaylen Brown, Derrick White and Payton Pritchard a combined 9-for-59 (15%). According to tracking data, 47% of their 3-point attempts have been wide open over the four games, a rate above their season-long mark of 44% (fourth lowest). But they’ve shot 15-for-62 (24%) on those wide-open 3s.


Their weekend games against the Kings and Pelicans were just the third and fourth times the Celtics had the top eight players in their rotation all available. Their when-healthy starting lineup (with Kristaps Porziņģis) has now been outscored by 8.9 points per 100 possessions (scoring just 107.9 per 100) in its 138 minutes.

The Celtics are 11-5 within the top nine in the East, with narrow losses to both the Magic and Hawks. They’ll host them both this coming weekend and will be at a rest disadvantage on Saturday against Atlanta, currently 5-1 in the second game of back-to-backs.

The Rockets have won three straight games, winning a big game in Memphis on Thursday to remain in second place in the West.
Three takeaways

The winning streak has been the Rockets’ best three-game stretch of offense this season (125.6 points scored per 100 possessions). Jalen Green has averaged a relatively efficient 29.7 points over the three games, with wins over the Lakers and Grizzlies being just the seventh and eighth times this season that he’s made at least half his shots.


The Rockets continue to dominate the possession battle. They had seven fewer turnovers and six more offensive rebounds than the Grizzlies on Thursday and have averaged 9.9 more shooting opportunities than their opponents over their last 10 games. Their season-long differential (6.5 more per game) would be the third biggest for any team in the last 26 seasons, trailing only the last two Toronto teams that Rockets guard Fred VanVleet played for.


While the offense has improved, the Rockets’ four games without Jabari Smith Jr. (fractured hand) have been their worst four-game stretch of defense this season (117.8 allowed per 100 possessions). Their opponents have shot much better in the paint and they’ve also seen a big drop in defensive rebounding percentage.

With the defense having seen some slippage, the Rockets will play seven of their next nine games against teams that rank in the top eight offensively. That includes another huge game against the Grizzlies on Monday.

The Grizzlies went 2-1 in a trio of big games within the top eight in the Western Conference, getting Ja Morant back from a five-game absence along the way.
Three takeaways

On Thursday, the Grizzlies shot 0-for-6 on clutch shots vs. Houston, with Morant (in his first game back) going 0-for-3 down the stretch. Two nights later, they were 4-for-6 in the clutch, with Morant coming up with two buckets in the final minute to turn a two-point deficit into a two-point win over Minnesota. Overall, the Grizzlies have the league’s biggest differential between their record in non-clutch games (19-4, third best) and their record in games within five in the last five (6-10, sixth worst).


Jaren Jackson Jr.’s offense picked up in Morant’s absence and hasn’t slowed down with the point guard’s return. Jackson has averaged 29.7 points on 52% shooting over the last six games. The league’s fifth-ranked defense continues to be much stronger with him on the floor, and Jackson’s on pace to be the first player in the last five seasons to average at least 1.5 steals and 1.5 blocks.


Morant’s return has brought with it the return of a starting lineup that outscored opponents by 57 points in its first 40 minutes. It was even (64-64) in a little less than 20 total minutes against the Rockets and Wolves last week and has now scored 201 points on 136 offensive possessions (148 per 100). The Grizzlies remain one of four teams without a lineup that’s played at least 100 total minutes.

With their two wins last week, the Grizzlies are 4-8 vs. the top eight in the West. That includes an 0-2 mark against the Rockets, who’ve outscored Memphis by 43 points on fast breaks (41-15) and second chances (45-28) over the two meetings. The third is Monday in Houston.

The Knicks lost four out of five games for the first time, getting clobbered by the Thunder on Friday. But they responded with one of their best (and most important) wins of the season, eviscerating the Bucks’ defense on Sunday afternoon.
Three takeaways

The five games before their win over Milwaukee were, by far, the Knicks’ worst offensive stretch of this season (109.1 points scored per 100 possessions), with their three perimeter starters combining to shoot 15-for-76 (20%) from 3-point range. But three of those five games came against the league’s top two defenses and their 140 points on 100 possessions on Sunday was the most efficient game for any team against the Bucks’ defense (which ranked ninth) by a wide margin.


The one good thing from the loss to the Thunder was that the Knicks only committed 12 turnovers against the team that leads the league in opponent turnover rate by a wide margin. The Knicks have started to turn teams over themselves a little bit (not a lot) and have committed 27 fewer turnovers than their opponents over their last 11 games, having had a differential of plus-4 over their first 29. Improved shooting is the biggest factor in their offensive jump, but they’ve also seen the league’s fourth-biggest drop in turnover rate from last season.


The Knicks’ starters don’t just play a lot of minutes. Karl-Anthony Towns missed their loss to the Magic last Monday, but all five starters have been available for 35 of the team’s 40 games, with the Wolves being the only other team with a lineup that’s played in at least 30. Jalen Brunson went to the locker room with a right shoulder injury early in the third quarter on Sunday but returned to score 12 of his 44 points in eight minutes spanning the third and fourth.

The Knicks are just four games into a stretch where they’re playing 12 of 14 at home, with the only road games being short trips to Philadelphia and Brooklyn. They’ll be at a rest disadvantage against the Pistons on Monday when a win would give the franchise its best record through 41 games in the last 28 seasons (since they were 29-12 in 1996-97).

The Nuggets have won seven of their last nine games and kept their spot in the top four in the West with a comeback win in Dallas on Sunday afternoon.
Three takeaways

The Nuggets erased a 17-point, first-quarter deficit on Sunday, only to fall into a 19-point hole in the third quarter. But they came back from that one too, outscoring the Mavs (who were without both Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving) by 29 points (43-14) over the last 15 minutes. That gave the Nuggets 11 wins (they’re 11-15) in games they trailed by double-digits, a total that leads the league (no other team has more than nine) and is only two short of their total last season (13-20).


They’ve now been 14.1 points per 100 possessions in the second halves of games (plus-10.9, second best) than they’ve been in first halves (minus-3.2, 19th). The bigger difference has been on defense, but Jamal Murray and Russell Westbrook have also scored much more efficiently in the second half (combined true shooting percentage of 59.6%) than they have in the first half (49.8%).


Aaron Gordon returned from a nine-game absence and came off the bench on Sunday (when bench minutes were a huge part of the two comebacks). It was the Nuggets’ second win in a game where they were outscored with Nikola Jokić on the floor. It’s possible that, when Gordon returns to the starting lineup, he replaces Christian Braun instead of Westbrook, because Westbrook’s minutes with Jokić have been terrific and the bench has also been improved with Westbrook in the starting group.

This is a weird week that’s taking the Nuggets from Texas back home to play a single, rest-disadvantage game against a team from Texas before they then fly to Florida for the weekend. The rest-disadvantage game is their first of three meetings with the second-place Rockets.

The Pacers are one of two undefeated teams in 2025, and their six-game winning streak was legitimized by a double-digit win in Cleveland on Sunday.
Three takeaways

All six wins have been by 12 points or more, and the Pacers rank in the top three on both ends of the floor this month. Their first game of 2025 (at Miami) was their most efficient offensive performance of the season, and their win in Cleveland on Sunday was their best defensive performance (93 points allowed on 98 possessions), even when you don’t take into account that the Cavs have one of the best offenses of the last 30 years.


The Pacers’ starting lineup has continued to dominate. Its outscored opponents by 18.1 points per 100 possessions, the best mark (by a wide margin) among the seven lineups that have played at least 250 minutes. But they also beat the Bulls on Wednesday without Myles Turner and didn’t have Tyrese Haliburton (hamstring tightness) in the second half in Cleveland. The Indiana bench has not been good this season (it still ranks 24th), but it had some great minutes against the best team in the league.


At one point the Pacers were 2-11 on the road. But they’ve since won nine of their 10 games away from Gainbridge Fieldhouse.

The Pacers have a two-game lead in the win column for one of the final guaranteed playoff spots in the East. But they will play the Cavs again on Tuesday and have a huge game in Detroit two nights later. The road team has won the first two meetings between the Pacers and the eighth-place Pistons, with Indiana having been without Andrew Nembhard when they lost on the day after Thanksgiving.

Since mid-December, the Wolves have been alternating three-game losing streaks and three-game winning streaks. The latest streak came to an end with a tough, two-point loss to the Grizzlies on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Donte DiVincenzo replaced Mike Conley in the starting lineup last week when the new group outscored the Wolves’ opponents by 15 points (16.5 per 100 possessions) in 52 total minutes. DiVincenzo had nine or 10 assists in two of the four games while also continuing to shoot well from beyond the arc. He’s 43-for-96 (44.8%) from 3-point range over the last 13 games, up from 31.9% before that.


There have been two games in the last three seasons (including playoffs) in which neither team led by more than six points, and the Wolves have been involved in both, winning Game 4 of the first round in Phoenix last April and losing to the Grizzlies on Saturday. They lead the league with 25 clutch games this season and are 12-13 in those games, ranking 29th in clutch offense (95.9 points scored per 100 possessions).


Conley is 0-for-9 on clutch shots, but he was on the floor down the stretch of the Wolves’ two clutch wins last week. And he replaced Jaden McDaniels for offense in the final seconds on Saturday, when Anthony Edwards came up short on a step-back 3 for the win. Edwards is 3-for-7 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime, though that doesn’t include the huge two step-backs he hit down the stretch against the Clippers last Monday.

It seems likely that the Wolves’ streak of three-game streaks will come to an end this week because for it to continue, they’d have to lose to the Wizards and beat the Cavs. They’re just 7-4 (3-0 since Thanksgiving) against the 10 teams that are currently below .500.

The Clippers have lost four of five for the first time this season, slipping to seventh place in the West.
Three takeaways

It’s been a relatively bad stretch on both ends of the floor, with three of the four losses coming by 18 points or more. The one loss that was close (last Monday in Minnesota) came after the Clippers led by 19 midway through the second quarter. They were a very good third-quarter team through their first 32 games, but have been outscored by more than 30 points per 100 possessions in the third period over these last five.


The Clippers have shot 31.9% from 3-point range over the five-game stretch. They only rank 21st in 3-point rate (40.1% of their shots), but have the league’s third biggest differential between their record when they’ve shot the league average (35.9%) or better from beyond the arc (14-3, with nine straight wins) and their record when they have not (6-14).


When it comes to shooting well from 3-point range, it doesn’t help that the Clippers rank last in the percentage of their 3-point attempts that have come off the catch (60%) and 28th in the percentage that are wide open (43%).

The Clippers are scheduled to play six of their next seven games at home. They have two back-to-backs over that stretch, with Wednesday and Thursday (at Portland) being their first back-to-back since Kawhi Leonard’s return.

The Mavs got their first two wins (after losing their first four games) without both Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving, beating the Lakers and Blazers at home. But their most important game last week was Sunday when they blew two big leads in a loss to the Nuggets.
Three takeaways

Bench minutes were big in the Mavs’ two wins last week. Over this five-game stretch without both of the star guards, Jaden Hardy has averaged 15.4 points (shooting 14-for-27 from 3-point range) in only 22.6 minutes, and the Mavs have been at their best with him on the floor.


Klay Thompson has shot better from 3-point range (16-for-41, 39%) than he has from 2-point range (8-for-23, 35%) over the last five games. His 3s are a lot more frequent and more important (especially when the stars are healthy), but his 33-for-75 (44%) shooting in the paint this season would be the worst mark of his career by a wide margin.


The Mavs came back from 10 points down with less than five minutes left against the Blazers on Thursday, going on a 16-0 run to pull out the win. They’ve also lost four of the last five games (all without Dončić) that they’ve led by double-digits, though they’ve still been at their best (plus-7.7 points per 100 possessions) in the fourth quarter, with Thompson and Irving being two of the eight players who’ve shot better than 40% on at least 50 fourth-quarter 3-point attempts.

The Mavs will host the Nuggets again on Tuesday, and they’ll also play the Thunder twice in the next 11 days. They’ve split their first two meetings with Oklahoma City, with the loss in the NBA Cup quarterfinals being the Mavs’ worst offensive performance (104 points on 100 possessions) in the 20 games for which they’ve had both Dončić and Irving.

The Lakers went 0-2 on a trip to Texas before having two home games postponed by the wildfires in Southern California.
Three takeaways

The Lakers had a rest advantage on Tuesday against the Mavs, but they couldn’t get stops, getting outscored inside and getting torched from the perimeter. Their two games in Texas were two of their three worst defensive games of the season (128 points allowed per 100 possessions or more), with one of them coming against what was the league’s 14th-ranked offense and the other coming against the Mavs without both Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving.


Overall, the Lakers are one of only eight teams that have allowed more points per 100 possessions than they did last season (114.8, 17th). They’ve seen the league’s second-biggest drop in defensive rebounding percentage and the third-biggest jump in the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come in the paint.


Over his five games with the Lakers, the team has been 28.6 points per 100 possessions better with Dorian Finney-Smith on the floor (plus 10.6) than it’s been with him on the bench (minus 18). After a rough start to the third quarter in Dallas on Tuesday, their starting lineup with Max Christie as the fifth guy is now a plus-3 in 123 total minutes.

The Lakers remain in L.A. for the next 11 days, with their only road game in that stretch against the Clippers on Sunday. It’s the first of four meetings between the two L.A. teams, with the Lakers having won three of the four (all by five points or fewer) last season.

The Bucks saw a three-game winning streak come to an end in resounding fashion, losing by 34 points at Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon.
Three takeaways

After seven straight starts, Khris Middleton returned to the bench last week. When the decision was made, Middleton had played just 96 total minutes with Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Through Sunday, their current starting lineup — with Andre Jackson Jr. and Taurean Prince on the wings — has been outscored by 4.6 points per 100 possessions, the second-worst mark among 14 lineups that have played at least 200 minutes.


The Bucks had climbed into the top 10 on defense by allowing just 105.9 points per 100 possessions over a 12-game stretch leading into Sunday. Their loss to the Knicks was, by a wide margin, their worst defensive game of the season (140 points allowed on 100 possessions) as they’ve seen the league’s 10th-biggest drop in points allowed per 100 from last season.


The loss on Sunday also dropped the Bucks to 0-8 against the top three teams in the East. They’re 8-1 against other teams that currently have winning records, though they’ve still yet to play seven of them.

One of the teams they’ve yet to face is the Kings, who’ve won seven straight games and will be in Milwaukee on Tuesday. The Bucks are 2-0 against the fourth-place Magic, who have more losses (18) than the Bucks.

Paolo Banchero made his return on Friday and scored 34 points in less than 27 minutes in his first game in more than 10 weeks. But the Magic lost an important game to the Bucks and continued to suffer more injuries.
Three takeaways

With Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs still out, Banchero didn’t ease his way back into the Orlando offense on Friday. He registered a usage rate of 46.8%, the highest rate of his career (166 games, including playoffs).


He had a more normal usage rate in the Magic’s win Sunday over the Sixers when he put his team up three with a pull-up jumper in the final minute. Eighteen of his 29 shots over the two games came from outside the paint, but he also had 21 free throw attempts and the Magic’s 27th-ranked offense scored relatively efficiently (116.7 points per 100 possessions) in his 54 minutes on the floor.


Wendell Carter Jr. has been coming off the bench for the last six games and has played less than 20 minutes in three of the six. Even with Goga Bitadze suffering a hip injury late in the second quarter on Sunday, Jonathan Isaac was on the floor instead of Carter down the stretch. Carter’s effective field goal percentage of 48.9% is the lowest mark of his career and down from 60% last season.

The Magic are now 7-9 in games played between the eight Eastern Conference teams that currently have winning records, set to visit Milwaukee and Boston this week.

Three takeaways

The difference between the winning streak and the six-game losing streak that preceded it has been about even on both ends of the floor, but slightly bigger on defense. The Kings’ win in Boston on Friday (certainly their best win of the season) was just the second time the Celtics’ second-ranked offense has been held under a point per possession.


The Celtics had a rough shooting night from beyond the arc, but four of the seven opponents have shot better than the league average from 3-point range. The Kings have seen improvement in their paint defense, have forced more turnovers and lead the league in defensive rebounding percentage over these last two weeks.


De’Aaron Fox missed three of the seven games, returning for the Kings’ win in Chicago on Sunday. Keon Ellis replaced Fox in the starting lineup, but while the Kings have been at their best (plus 9.9 points per 100 possessions) with Ellis on the floor this season, he’s not a point guard, recording assists on less than 16% of his possessions. The playmaking was handled by Malik Monk, Domantas Sabonis and DeMar DeRozan, who all averaged at least 4.7 assists over Fox’s absence.

The Kings complete their three-game trip in Milwaukee on Tuesday. Then they’ll have rest advantages against both the Rockets and Wizards at home. Their first meeting with Houston (a nine-point win) was the Rockets’ worst defensive game of the season (120 points on 94 possessions).

The Heat led the Kings by 17 with eight minutes left in regulation, only to lose in double-overtime, with the collapse including an eight-second violation, a crucial miss on a wide-open corner 3, missed free throws and a bad foul at the end of the first OT. They lead the league with four losses (they’re 12-4) in games they led by at least 15 points.


The three games since the loss in Sacramento have been the Heat’s best three-game stretch of defense this season (99.3 points allowed per 100 possessions). They didn’t score much more efficiently in their five-point win in Utah on Thursday (97 points on 96 possessions) than they did when they lost by 36 to the Jazz five days earlier (100 on 103).


Nikola Jović has been handling the ball a lot more of late. He’s averaged 2.7 minutes of possession (9.9% of his minutes on the floor) in January, up from 1.2 minutes (6.0%) before that. Of course, he’s not looking to shoot off the dribble, as he’s just 2-for-13 on pull-up jumpers this season.

The Heat have not been more than three games over .500 this season, and getting there will be tough, as their trip continues with a game against the Clippers on Monday. The last two games of the trip are also the last two games of Jimmy Butler’s team suspension.

The Warriors were without six rotation players (including Curry, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green and Jonathan Kuminga) in Indiana on Friday and still went 10 deep in their rotation. They’re one of three teams — the Hornets and Sixers are the others — that don’t have a lineup that’s played at least 80 minutes this season.


Their current, when-everybody’s-healthy lineup — Curry, Dennis Schröder, Wiggins, Green and Trayce Jackson-Davis — has been outscored by 16 points in its 71 minutes, having scored just 98.7 points per 100 possessions. Schröder now has an effective field goal percentage of just 38.8% (what would be the lowest mark of his career) on 139 shots with the Warriors, down from 54.2% (what would be the highest mark of his career) on 325 shots with Brooklyn this season.

The Warriors’ four-game trip will conclude with a critical game in Minnesota on Wednesday when a win would give them the head-to-head tie-breaker over the eighth-place Wolves. Over the first three meetings, the Warriors have been 45.4 points per 100 possessions better with Curry on the floor (plus 13.2) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus 32.2).

The Detroit Pistons are a winning team. A 9-2 stretch has them over .500 and in eighth place in the Eastern Conference.
Three takeaways

The last 11 games have been a relatively soft stretch of schedule, with the Pistons’ three wins last week coming against Portland, Brooklyn and Toronto. But they’ve also won six of their last eight games against other teams currently over .500.


The bigger difference between the Pistons’ last 11 games and their first 28 has been on offense, where they’ve shot 39% from 3-point range over the 9-2 stretch. That includes 9-for-15 on clutch 3s, with seven of the nine wins being within five points in the last five minutes. They lost a double-digit lead against Toronto on Saturday but finished on a 14-5 run to improve to 13-9 in clutch games. (They were just 8-27 in the clutch last season.)


Over their six games since Jaden Ivey was lost to a broken fibula, the Pistons’ two most-used lineups (with either Malik Beasley or Ausar Thompson in Ivey’s place) have outscored their opponents by 18.8 points per 100 possessions in 81 total minutes. But bench minutes weren’t great on Thursday when the Warriors outscored Detroit by 25 points (43-18) over 13 minutes spanning the first and second quarters. Cade Cunningham has a huge on-off differential over the six games.

The Pistons’ schedule will start to get tougher this week, with their next nine games all against teams currently at or above .500.

The Suns went 4-1 in their second stretch of five games in seven days, climbing back to .500 and into 10th place in the West.
Three takeaways

Week 12 was a week for lineup changes (see Milwaukee and Minnesota), and the Suns made a pair of them, replacing Bradley Beal and Jusuf Nurkić with Ryan Dunn and Mason Plumlee. The new lineup wasn’t great in its first game (last Monday in Philadelphia), but still outscored the Suns’ opponents by 19.9 points per 100 possessions over 45 total minutes last week.


Of course, that success was mostly about the defensive end of the floor, where the opponents shot just 8-for-40 (20%) from 3-point range and 8-for-a15 (53%) from the free-throw line. Four of those opponents rank in the bottom 10 offensively and the fifth was the Hawks without Jalen Johnson. So the jury is still out.


Beal responded well to coming off the bench for the first time in almost nine years (since March of 2016), scoring 25 points on 10-for-15 shooting in Philly last Monday. He still ranked third on the team in total minutes (160, 40 more than Dunn) over the five games and was on the floor for all of the Suns’ clutch minutes last week. Nurkić’s move to the bench didn’t go so well. After he registered a minus-22 in a brutal loss in Charlotte on Tuesday, he was DNP’d (in favor of rookie Oso Ighodaro) the next two games before missing the Suns’ win over the Hornets on Sunday with an illness.

The Suns go from a stretch of five games in seven days to their longest road trip of the season (five games over nine days). It begins Tuesday in Atlanta and includes a visit to Washington for Beal, who scored 43 points (on 16-for-21 shooting) in his initial return to D.C. last February.

The Spurs have lost three straight games to fall back below .500 and into 12th place in the West.
Three takeaways

From Dec. 29 through Feb. 3, the Spurs are playing 16 of 17 games against teams currently with winning records. The one exception was their game in Chicago last Monday when they blew a 15-point, fourth-quarter lead. They were 14-0 when leading by double-digits in the fourth period through December, but are now 0-2 in January. Over their four January games, the Spurs have scored 116.2 points per 100 possessions through the first three quarters, but just 79.8 per 100 in the fourth and overtime.


The Spurs went scoreless on their final eight possessions in Chicago, turning the ball over twice and shooting 0-for-8, with all eight shots coming at least 13 feet from the basket. So with the game on the line, they couldn’t get to the rim against the defense that yields the second most points in the paint per 100 possessions.


Overall, the Spurs have taken 44% of their shots in the paint, the league’s sixth-lowest rate and down from 49% (13th lowest) last season. Victor Wembanyama has taken just 36% of his shots in the paint, down from 51% last season. The difference between how effectively he’s shot in the paint (69.4%) and how effectively he’s shot from the outside (49.6%) is the fourth biggest differential among 146 players with at least 100 field goal attempts both in and outside the paint.

Their Saturday game in L.A. was postponed, but the Spurs are set to play at Crypto.com Arena on Monday. Their two losses at home to the Lakers were two of their three worst defensive games (combined 123.8 points allowed per 100 possessions) in which Wembanyama has been in uniform.

The Hawks went 2-4 on their longest road trip of the season, and they remained at .500 over the weekend with their game against the Rockets on Saturday being postponed.
Three takeaways

The Hawks are also 2-4 without Jalen Johnson, who has missed four of the last five games and wasn’t going to play against Houston. The first win came in Sacramento (in November), with Dyson Daniels stripping De’Aaron Fox with two seconds left. The second came in Utah on Tuesday, with Trae Young draining a 49-footer at the buzzer. Atlanta has the point differential of a team that’s 16-22 but is 9-4 (only two teams have more wins) in games that were within three points in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime.


Their regular starting lineup hasn’t been great, getting outscored by a point (0.2 per 100 possessions) in its 282 minutes. But the Hawks have been outscored by 48 points (16.4 per 100) in 127 minutes with the other four starters on the floor without Johnson. The bigger difference has been on offense, where they’ve scored just 98.2 per 100 in those no-Johnson minutes.


But their first five games of 2025 have been the Hawks’ worst stretch of defense this season (122.7 points allowed per 100 possessions). Losses to the Nuggets, Clippers and Suns on the road trip were three of the seven times they’ve allowed their opponent to shoot better than 68% in the paint.

The Hawks will face the Suns again on Tuesday, then beginning a three-game trip in Chicago. They lead the 10th-place Bulls by a game and a half but will need to win on Wednesday (when both teams will be playing the second game of a back-to-back) to avoid losing the head-to-head tie-breaker, having allowed Chicago to score 124.3 points per 100 possessions over the first three meetings.

The Bulls have beaten some good teams in the last few weeks, but they’re still hovering below .500 and in 10th place in the East.
Three takeaways

With the Bulls down one in the final minute last Monday, Coby White had two incredible scores against Victor Wembanyama, a reverse scoop on an iso against the big man and then a thunderous dunk as Wembanyama came with weak-side help. After seeing a big jump in drives last season (13.6 per 36 minutes), White hasn’t driven quite as much (12.3 per 36) this year, but he’s been finishing better and getting to the line more.


The Bulls registered their highest offensive rebounding percentage of the season and had eight more shooting opportunities than the Spurs, easily their best differential of the season. Two nights later in Indiana, they had 16 fewer shooting opportunities than the Pacers, not their worst discrepancy. Their season-long discrepancy of 4.5 per game ranks 28th, slightly ahead of those of the Jazz and Wizards.


With White missing their game against the Kings on Sunday, Lonzo Ball got his first start in almost exactly three years (since Jan. 14, 2022). He’s totaled 27 points (shooting 9-for-15 from 3-point range) over the last two games and the Bulls have outscored their opponents by more than 20 points per 100 possessions in 143 minutes with Ball and Josh Giddey on the floor together.

The Bulls have a winning record (15-13) within the Eastern Conference, but with their loss to the Kings on Sunday, they’re 3-8 against the West. They lost in New Orleans on opening night and will face the Pelicans again (likely with Zion Williamson this time) on Tuesday. That’s the middle of a five-game homestand that includes a big game against the ninth-place Hawks the following night.

Joel Embiid has missed the last four games, and the Sixers remain outside the SoFi Play-In Tournament group in the East.
Three takeaways

The Sixers are 2-5 in January, and their loss to the Pelicans on Friday (in which bench minutes were pretty brutal) was probably their worst of the season. They’ve lost the last five games where they’ve had Tyrese Maxey and Paul George, but not Embiid, allowing almost 120 points per 100 possessions over the five.


Maxey’s most efficient scoring season (true shooting percentage of 60.5%) was the one (2022-23) when he played more than half of his minutes alongside James Harden. He’s seen big drops in efficiency in each of the two seasons since then, and his mark this season (55.0%) ranks 39th among the 43 players who’ve averaged at least 20 points per game.


Even with their losses to the Suns and Pelicans last week, the Sixers have the league’s biggest differential between their record vs. the 13 teams currently at or below .500 (11-5) and their record vs. the 17 teams currently over .500 (4-17, fourth worst). Statistically, the bigger difference has been on offense.

Their loss in Orlando on Sunday was the start of a stretch where the Sixers are playing 15 of 16 against the group currently above .500. They also have four back-to-backs in the next 17 days, so, even if Embiid is feeling well, his availability will likely be limited. The first of those back-to-backs is Tuesday and Wednesday against the Thunder and Knicks.

After a competitive, 2-3 road trip, the Blazers suffered their 12th loss by at least 20 points when they returned home to face the Heat on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Jerami Grant has missed the last seven games, with Deni Avdija replacing him in the starting lineup. The two lineups have played almost the same number of minutes (125 vs. 122), with the Avdija lineup having been much better. It outscored the Blazers’ opponents by 8.3 points per 100 possessions over 74 minutes on the five-game trip before Deandre Ayton missed their loss to the Heat over the weekend.


The Blazers have shot 36% from 3-point range over their last eight games, an improvement from 33% before that. But the improvement is largely about one guy. While everybody else on the team has combined to shoot 60-for-194 (31%) from beyond the arc over these last eight games, Anfernee Simons is 39-for-82 (48%). Simons’ usage rate has fluctuated over the last five seasons, but his efficiency (true shooting percentage) has been pretty consistent.


Those 12 losses by at least 20 points are just two shy of both the Blazers’ total last season (14) and the Wizards’ league-leading 14. No other team has lost more than seven games by 20-plus.

The Blazers played 21 of their first 37 games on the road. Their loss to the Heat on Saturday was the start of a five-game homestand, but their weekend back-to-back against Houston and Chicago is the start of their third (and final) stretch of five games in seven days.

The Jazz have been missing some players, but they put an end to a nine-game home losing streak with an overtime win over the similarly shorthanded Nets on Sunday.
Three takeaways

With Keyonte George out, rookie Isaiah Collier has started the last five games, and he certainly seems to be more of a point guard than George, averaging 7.8 assists over that stretch. The scoring wasn’t there until Sunday when Collier had 23 points (more than the previous four games combined), capped by the game-winning bucket (where he forced his way to the rim) with 2.4 seconds left in overtime.


The Jazz blew a 13-point, fourth-quarter lead against the Nets, but still won, improving to 9-9 in games they led by double-digits. Those nine losses are tied (with the 6-9 Pelicans) for the league lead and more than the Jazz had last season (26-7). Their 29th-ranked defense has been much worse in the second halves of games (120.9 points allowed per 100 possessions) than it has been before halftime (114.8).


Over the previous six seasons (2018-19 through last season), the Jazz had the league’s biggest home-road differential regarding winning percentage (.664 vs. .451). This season, they’re 7-14 on the road and 3-14 at home, what would be the third biggest road-home differential in NBA history. (They had the biggest before their weekend, road-home back-to-back.)

The win over Brooklyn starts a stretch of four straight games against other teams with losing records. The Jazz will have a long stay in New Orleans as they play their first two games against the last-place Pelicans, having a two-game break after the first meeting on Friday.

Three takeaways

Cam Thomas (zero), Cam Johnson (zero) and D’Angelo Russell (14) have combined to play 14 total minutes over the last five games, and the Nets have lost all five. It’s been their worst five-game stretch of offense this season (101.0 points scored per 100 possessions), and they couldn’t come close to the league average on Sunday when they had a rest advantage against the league’s 29th-ranked defense.


One of the bright spots on Sunday was Ben Simmons, who’s totaled 24 points (on 12-for-18 shooting) and 16 assists over the last two games and has now played almost twice as many minutes (706) as he did all of last season (359). He still hasn’t made a shot from outside the paint since Feb. of 2023, but Simmons has been looking more confident in the paint of late.


Day’Ron Sharpe missed the Nets’ loss to Detroit on Wednesday but has otherwise been getting 15-20 minutes per game off the bench. The Nets are 45-76 over the last two seasons but have somehow outscored their opponents by 79 points (3.6 per 100 possessions) in Sharpe’s 1,208 total minutes since the start of last season.

The Nets will play two more bottom-10 defenses – those of the Blazers and Lakers – as they complete their six-game trip this week. After that, they will have played 26 of their 43 games on the road.

Zion Williamson is back and the Pelicans are showing some signs of life.
Three takeaways

Williamson’s two games last week were narrow losses to good teams (Minnesota and Boston), and the Pelicans got a win in Philadelphia (with Williamson serving a team suspension) in between. Steals certainly aren’t a full measure of a player’s defensive impact, but his eight steals last week show that he was active and engaged on that end of the floor, where the Pelicans allowed only 92 points per 100 possessions in his 56 minutes.


Alas, the Pelicans lost their best defender for an extended period last week, with Herb Jones suffering a labrum tear in his right shoulder. Though he was starting (and defending other starters), the Pelicans have allowed 6.6 fewer points per 100 possessions with Jones on the floor (112.5) than they have with him off the floor (119.1).


The Pelicans are one loss being the first team to match its total from last season (49-33). They’ve seen the league’s biggest drops in efficiency on both ends of the floor, and their overall drop (14 points per 100 possessions worse than they were last season) now ranks as the third biggest since the Last Dance. The only bigger ones came from the 2010-11 Cavs (LeBron James’ first departure) and the 2019-20 Warriors (Kevin Durant’s departure, injuries to Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson).

The last-place Pelicans will get their first two shots at the 14th-place Jazz with a two-game series that starts Friday. First, they’ll complete their three-game trip in Chicago, having beat the Bulls on opening night.

Bench minutes have been pretty good. Chris Boucher has shot 18-for-24 (including 11-for-15 from 3-point range) over his last three games, with the Raptors outscoring their opponents by more than 27 points per 100 possessions in his 51 total minutes.

The Hornets put an end to their 10-game losing streak by beating the Suns on Tuesday, and they were competitive in Phoenix over the weekend.
Three takeaways

With their two games in L.A. being postponed, the Hornets have still had just five games with LaMelo Ball, Brandon Miller and Mark Williams all in the lineup. But their loss in Phoenix on Sunday was, easily, the best outing for their when-healthy starting lineup (with Josh Green and Miles Bridges), which outscored the Suns by 14 points in less than 14 minutes. Of course, it was the starters mostly on the floor as the Hornets blew a nine-point lead with less than seven minutes left.


Charlotte dominated the glass over the two games, grabbing 56.3% of available rebounds, the best mark for any team against the Suns this season. Williams had 16 boards in less than 30 minutes on Sunday and, even though he’s played in just 14 of their 36 games, the Hornets have been the league’s second-most-improved rebounding team this season.


The biggest reason for that improvement is Moussa Diabate, who has yet to play in January because he’s on a two-way contract and has already played in 30 games. The Hornets might not have any vets that contenders would be interested in before the deadline, but it would be good if they could free up a roster spot and give a standard contract to the 6-9 rookie who ranks third in offensive rebounding percentage among 295 players who’ve averaged at least 15 minutes. The Hornets have outscored their opponents by 5.4 points per 100 possessions in Diabate’s 537 minutes on the floor.

The Hornets still have two games left on what was supposed to be a five-game trip, but those are their only two games scheduled for this week. They’ve scored just 92.7 points per 100 possessions (their second-worst mark vs. any opponent) as they’ve lost their first two meetings (both without Ball) against the Bulls, who they’ll visit on Friday.

After winning their first game of 2025, the Wizards have lost six straight, and they’re back to ranking last on both ends of the floor.
Three takeaways

The Wizards’ starting lineup (featuring two rookies) cracked the 100-minute mark last week and has been outscored by 32.2 points per 100 possessions, what would be the worst mark for a lineup that played at least 100 minutes in the 18 seasons for which we have lineup data.


The Wizards’ loss to the Thunder on Sunday was the first time this season (30 games) that Jordan Poole didn’t make a 3-pointer. He shot 0-for-6 from deep as the Wizards suffered their worst loss of the season (41 points), but has still seen the eighth biggest jump in 3-point percentage (from 32.6% to 40.5%) among 160 players with at least 100 attempts in each of the last two seasons.


It was a tie game in the final minute in Philadelphia on Wednesday, with the Wizards (who lost at home the night before) having erased a 15-point, fourth-quarter deficit. But they missed on two chances to take the lead and lost by six. That was their 23rd straight loss in the second games of back-to-backs, a streak that goes back to February of 2023. They’ve allowed 122 points per 100 possessions in their five games without rest this season, with the two of the five opponents having top-10 offenses and two of the five having bottom-10 offenses.

The Wizards’ will try again to end that no-rest losing streak when they host the Wolves (with a rest disadvantage) on Monday. They’ll have another back to back when they begin their longest road trip of the season (six games over 10 days) in San Francisco over the weekend.

Because the Emirates NBA Cup Championship doesn’t count as a regular-season game, the Thunder’s winning streak is now at 15 games, tying the Cavs’ 15-0 start for the longest streak in the league in the last two seasons. More than half of those wins (eight) have come against teams that currently have winning records.
Three takeaways

On Tuesday, the Thunder trailed Minnesota by 12. Two nights later, they were down 16 to the Clippers. On Friday, they trailed New York by 14. On Sunday afternoon, they were down 12 to Boston. Those four teams are a combined 77-16 (.828) when leading by double-digits against teams that aren’t the Thunder. But Oklahoma City won all four games, outscoring the opponents by an amazing 40.9 points per 100 possessions (allowing just 85.6 per 100) after halftime.


With those four wins, the Thunder are 9-4 when trailing by double-digits, which would be the best such mark in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data, topping that of the 2015-16 Warriors (12-8).


Shai Gilgeous-Alexander keeps showing that he can outshine other stars in big games (see his big block on Jayson Tatum in the fourth quarter on Sunday), averaging 33.1 points on a true shooting percentage of 66.4% over the winning streak. The Thunder have been 17.1 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (plus-16.9) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-0.2), with that being the third biggest differential among players who’ve played at least 500 minutes.

With the weekend wins over the Knicks and Celtics, the Thunder are 11-0 against the Eastern Conference. The Cavs (winners of 10 straight overall) are 10-0 against the West. So something has got to give when the two best teams in the league meet in Cleveland on Wednesday.

The Cavs have their second double-digit winning streak of the season (10 games), having swept a four-game trip out West and returning home to take care of business against the Hornets.
Three takeaways

Three of the Cavs’ four top players have averaged between 20.4 and 22.2 points over the winning streak, while the fourth (Jarrett Allen) has shot better than 72%. The Cavs continue to win with offensive balance and have recorded assists on 69.9% of their buckets during the winning streak. That’s the league’s sixth-highest rate over that stretch and up from 62.5% prior.


Max Strus has shot just 35% over his seven games back, but he had 15 points (shooting 4-for-8 from 3-point range) off the bench in the Cavs win over the Lakers, and Cleveland has continued to score efficiently in bench minutes (122.8 points per 100 possessions in Strus’ 159). For the season, the Cavs have outscored their opponents by 13.4 points per 100 possessions in 879 total minutes with just one of their starting guards and just one of their starting bigs on the floor.


The Cavs still aren’t as deep as they could be (Isaac Okoro has been out since Strus debuted), but all four of the top players have averaged fewer than 30 minutes per game over the winning streak. Only three of the 10 wins have been within five points in the last five minutes and one of those (their win in L.A. on Tuesday) was only within five in the last five for a single possession.

The Cavs have just one homestand longer than three games this season. It’s a four-game stand that began with their win over the Hornets on Sunday and continues with a visit from the Thunder on Wednesday night. As things stand, it’s a matchup of the second-best offense (the Cavs have scored 8.8 more points per 100 possessions than the league average) vs. the best defense in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data.

The Celtics won the first two games of their tough, four-game trip through the West, getting Kristaps Porzingis back for their impressive, 23-point win in Houston on Friday. But they were just another one of the Thunder’s victims on Sunday afternoon.
Three takeaways

The Celtics’ 27 points on 47 second-half possessions (0.57 per) on Sunday was the second least efficient half for any team this season. And it certainly wasn’t just about the 21 misses from beyond the arc, as Boston also shot just 3-for-12 in the paint and turned the ball over 10 times. The loss leaves the Knicks as the only team that hasn’t been held under a point per possession this season.


The Celtics’ paint defense, which had seen a big drop-off from last season, is getting better. Their opponents have shot just 44.1% in the paint over the last four games, down from 55.9% before that. Houston’s 15-for-37 (40.5%) in the paint on Friday was its worst mark of the season.


The loss in Oklahoma City was only the Celtics’ third defeat that wasn’t within five points in the last five minutes (it was within six in the last five). They’re still in the top six on both ends of the floor, with the point differential of a team that’s 29-7.

The only team the Celtics didn’t beat last season was the Nuggets, who they’ll face for the first time on Tuesday, the end of their four-game trip.

The Knicks’ nine-game winning streak came to an end with a second-half collapse in Oklahoma City on Friday. They’re not the only team to suffer that fate at the Paycom Center last week, but had another collapse in Chicago just 24 hours later.
Three takeaways

The Knicks’ rise from the bottom 10 to 13th (through Thursday) in defensive efficiency was certainly aided by the schedule, a stretch where they played 14 of 20 games against teams that currently rank in the bottom 10 offensively. They allowed 124.3 points per 100 possessions over the two weekend losses (against the league’s eighth and 14th-ranked offenses), including 139 on 98 (142 per 100) after halftime.


Josh Hart had 16 rebounds and 10 assists in Chicago on Saturday, playing more than 40 minutes for the fourth straight time. But he shot 0-for-5, scoring in single-digits for the second time in his 35 games, with both of those instances having come in losses to the Bulls. He still ranks third in effective field goal percentage (63.3%) among 152 players with at least 250 field goal attempts, a pretty incredible recovery from a career-low mark of 49.3% last season.


As indicated by Hart’s minutes, the Knicks’ rotation remains short — so much so that Precious Achiuwa and Karl-Anthony Towns have been playing together (including almost 18 minutes together on Saturday) on the frontline. Those double-big minutes have been pretty good, with the Knicks outscoring their opponents by 11.6 points per 100 possessions (and dominating the glass) in Achiuwa and Towns’ 112 total minutes on the floor together.

The Knicks will play 12 of their next 14 games at home, they’ll have a rest advantage when they host the Magic on Monday, and they’ll get another shot at the Thunder on Friday night.

The Rockets went 2-3 on a homestand interrupted by a two-game suspension for Amen Thompson and an injury to Jabari Smith Jr.
Three takeaways

The Rockets’ regular starting lineup has outscored opponents by 6.6 points per 100 possessions (allowing just 103.8 per 100) in its 416 minutes. But Houston has thus far been outscored by 3.3 per 100 (allowing 114.5 per 100) in 117 minutes with the other four starters on the floor without Smith.


The starting lineup with Thompson in Smith’s place was outscored by the Lakers by 15 points in less than 20 minutes on Sunday, but bench minutes were terrific, even though none of the four reserves – Steven Adams, Aaron Holiday, Jae’Sean Tate and Cam Whitmore – have had consistent roles this season. Super-sub Tari Eason has now missed the last nine games with a leg injury and the Rockets’ bench still ranks sixth.


With their wins over the Mavs and Lakers last week, the Rockets are tied with the Thunder for the best record (11-5) in games played between the nine Western Conference teams currently over .500.

They’ll have more opportunities for quality wins this month because the Rockets have the league’s toughest January schedule regarding cumulative opponent winning percentage (entering the month). They’re also playing 13 of their next 17 games on the road, which includes three games (two in Memphis) against the Grizzlies.

The Grizzlies have lost three of their four games since losing Ja Morant to a shoulder injury, in part because Morant hasn’t been the only guy out.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies still have a winning record (9-7) without Morant, having outscored their opponents by 5.9 points per 100 possessions over those 16 games. But with this four-game stretch since his shoulder injury, they’re 2-6 without him within the top 12 in the Western Conference, having scored just 109.2 per 100 over those eight games. Desmond Bane has been handling the ball more during this current absence and has 17 turnovers to go along with 25 assists over the last three.


The offense was OK in Sacramento on Friday, when the Grizzlies scored 133 points on 109 possessions, but had their worst defensive performance of the season. Jaylen Wells scored a career-high 30 points, shooting 8-for-9 from 3-point range. He’s on pace to be the first second-round pick in the last 13 seasons to start at least 50 games as a rookie for a winning team, but Wells may still prefer the college schedule. With that 8-for-9 performance after a two-day break, he’s 26-for-44 (59%) from 3-point range with at least two days of rest, but just 43-for-136 (32%) with zero or one day of rest.


Ten of the Grizzlies’ 16 games without Morant have been on the road. They’re 4-2 without him at home and, overall, have been 9.7 points per 100 possessions better at FedExForum (plus-12.2, third best) than they’ve been on the road (plus-2.5, eighth). That’s the league’s second-biggest home-road differential and it’s the bigger difference has been on the defensive end of the floor.

With one of their two five-game road trips in the books, the Grizzlies are home for big games against the Mavs and Rockets before heading back on the road. They’re currently just 2-7 (2-2 at home) in games played between the seven Western Conference teams that are more than one game over .500.

The Nuggets have won four of their last five games, splitting a thrilling home-and-home set against the Spurs over the weekend.
Three takeaways

Aaron Gordon has missed the last six games with a calf strain, so the Nuggets have had Gordon, Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokić together for just 13 of their 34 games. Russell Westbrook continues to start (and close) and now has 84 assists to Jokić. That’s the third most from any player to a single teammate, with his 4.8 assists to Jokic per 36 minutes on the floor together being the highest rate (by a healthy margin) among the 29 combinations where one player has at least 50 assists to the other.


The lineup with Westbrook in Gordon’s place has scored 136 points per 100 possessions, the highest mark among 43 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes. But Peyton Watson was on the floor down the stretch instead of Christian Braun on Saturday, tasked with guarding Victor Wembanyama. He missed two open 3s in the clutch but was a plus-21 in 34 minutes, and the Nuggets have scored more efficiently with Watson on the floor this season (113 points per 100 possessions) than they did last season (109 per 100).


With their win in San Antonio on Saturday, the Nuggets are 4-0 in overtime, having scored 59 points on 42 overtime offensive possessions (1.40 per). Jokić has 26 of those 59, having shot 11-for-15 over the four extra periods. He leads the league with 76 total points in the clutch and is the only player who’s shot better than 50% on at least 30 clutch shots.

The two games against the Spurs began a stretch in which the Nuggets are playing nine of 10 against teams currently over .500. Their 8-9 record within that group includes a 1-2 mark against the Clippers — who they’ll host (with a rest disadvantage) on Wednesday.

Kawhi Leonard made his season debut on Saturday and the new Clippers looked terrific in an easy, rest-advantage win over the Hawks.
Three takeaways

Leonard played a little less than 20 minutes and had some trouble finishing at the rim. But his legs looked pretty good as he made his first three 3-point attempts, and the Clippers allowed the Hawks to score just 41 points on 46 possessions with him on the floor.


Terance Mann also returned from an 11-game absence on Saturday, when Leonard replaced Derrick Jones Jr. in the starting lineup and the Clippers went 10 deep with their rotation. Their bench has been improved from last season, but ranks 28th over their last seven games, with the Clippers getting outscored by 15.9 points per 100 possessions with Norman Powell off the floor over that stretch.


The win over Atlanta came after the Clippers were held under a point per possession in both San Antonio and Oklahoma City, with Powell shooting 5-for-23 over the two games. They’ve now scored less than a point per possession eight times this season, having done so just three times last season.

After that single home game against the Hawks, the Clippers are back on the road for a pair of big games within the top 10 in the West. They’ll have another rest advantage in Denver on Wednesday and again against the Hornets over the weekend.

Counting the game (on Christmas) in which he was injured, the Mavs are 1-5 since Luka Dončić suffered a calf strain, sliding from fourth to sixth in the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

The Mavs have also been without Kyrie Irving (back issue) for two of the last three games, and they’re now 0-3 without either backcourt star. Their first two games without either were their two worst offensive games of the season, though the other end of the floor was a much bigger issue against Cleveland on Friday. The Mavs had as many double-digit losses last week (three) as they had previously.


When Dončić and/or Irving are out, Spencer Dinwiddie plays more. But the 31-year-old has shot just 22-for-64 (34%) over these last six games, now registering an effective field goal percentage of 46.6%, his lowest mark in the eight seasons where he’s attempted at least 200 shots. The Mavs have been outscored by 3.5 points per 100 possessions (scoring just 107.5 points per 100) in 295 minutes with Dinwiddie and Irving on the floor without Dončić.


The Mavs have still seen the league’s second-biggest jump in the percentage of their shots that have come in the paint from last season, but obviously have a tougher time scoring in the paint without Dončić. They’ve been outscored in the paint (by an average of 10.3 points) in each of these last six games.

Despite losses to the Rockets and Cavs last week, the Mavs still have a winning record (9-8) in games played between the 15 teams currently above .500. They play four of their next five games against that group, with a huge two-game series against the Nuggets starting Sunday.

The Lakers still have a negative point differential and are still a top-six team in the West, having gone 3-1 on their post-Christmas homestand before seeing a big comeback come up short in Houston on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Dorian Finney-Smith shot just 2-for-10 in his first two games with the Lakers but was better (8-for-14) over the weekend, and L.A. has outscored its opponents by 12.8 points per 100 possessions in his 94 minutes on the floor. If you subtract the game vs. Portland that Anthony Davis missed, Finney-Smith played most of his minutes at the four alongside Davis. There were also a few intriguing minutes with Rui Hachimura on the floor and a big backcourt of LeBron James and Austin Reaves.


Reaves continues to see an increasing role as a ball-handler. According to Second Spectrum tracking, he’s averaged 7.1 minutes of possession (most on the team by a healthy margin) over the Lakers’ last six games, up from 4.6 minutes (second behind James) before that.


And over those seven games, Reaves has been essential to the offense. L.A. has scored 128.5 points per 100 possessions in his 234 minutes on the floor, but just 82.9 per 100 in his 54 minutes on the bench.

The Lakers will have a rest advantage for their game in Dallas on Tuesday, followed by their longest homestand yet. It’s five games over nine days, with two big games against the Spurs included. The Lakers scored 123.8 points per 100 possessions (their third-best mark vs. any opponent) as they won the first two meetings (both in November) in San Antonio.

The Wolves were competitive against the Thunder (on the road) and Celtics last week. But, they’ve lost three straight games (again) after dropping a rest-advantage game in Detroit on Saturday (despite getting a career-high 53 points from Anthony Edwards).
Three takeaways

Edwards was 10-for-15 from 3-point range and 11-for-12 at the line on Saturday. His free throw rate (20.2 attempts per 100 shots from the field) is still the lowest mark of his career (and down from 32.5 per 100 last season), but he’s now at 42.1% on 9.9 attempts per game from beyond the arc, up from 35.7% on 6.7 attempts last season.


The Wolves went on a 6-1 run after Thanksgiving by holding their opponents to just 92.8 points per 100 possessions over that seven-game stretch. But they rank 28th defensively (118.7 allowed per 100) over their 3-6 stretch since then. The difference has been nearly as much about their opponents’ shooting in the paint (50% vs. 60%) as it’s been about 3-point shooting (29% vs. 38%).


Despite Edwards’ 53, the Wolves totaled just 105 points on 99 possessions on Saturday. They’ve now seen the league’s second-biggest drop in winning percentage from last season and, when you take the league average into account, are one of just three teams that have been at least 1.5 points per 100 possessions worse on both ends of the floor than they were in 2023-24.

The team that’s seen the biggest drops on both ends of the floor is, of course, the Pelicans, who the Wolves will face for the first time on Tuesday. That’s the back half of their first back-to-back since before Thanksgiving.

The Pacers blew a 19-point, second-half lead to the Bucks last week, but their offense is coming around, and they’re 8-3 since mid-December.
Three takeaways

The Pacers have still seen the league’s fourth biggest drop (-6.9) in points scored per 100 possessions from last season. But they’ve scored more than 124 per 100 in three of their last four games, with their win in Miami on Thursday being their most efficient performance of the season (128 on 96). Their starting lineup continues to give them leads and has scored 128.7 points per 100 possessions in its 75 minutes over this four-game stretch.


That second-half collapse against Milwaukee came with the Pacers scoring just 16 points on 23 possessions of zone defense from the Bucks, per Synergy tracking. Only Orlando has faced more possessions of zone per game than Indiana, which had better success against it (11 on nine) in Miami and ranks eighth in zone efficiency (0.94 points per possession) among the 13 teams that have faced at least 75 possessions of zone, according to Synergy.


Efficiency is about more than shooting. The Pacers had 18 turnovers in their loss to the Bucks on Tuesday, committing two straight when they were still down just five with less than two minutes left. But they’ve committed fewer than 10 in each of their last three wins and Tyrese Haliburton has a 23/0 assist/turnover ratio over their two games in 2025.

The Pacers have lost their last four games where they had an opportunity to get above .500. Their next chance is Monday in Brooklyn, where they lost last month with one of their worst offensive performances of the season (90 points on 97 possessions).

Three takeaways

Though Suggs missed the second half on Friday, the Magic found some offense in Toronto, just the third time this season that they’ve shot 40% or better from 3-point range. Their season-long mark (31.0%) is still the worst mark for any team in the last 12 seasons. Fourty-eight players have shot worse than 33% on at least 75 3-point attempts. The Magic have seven of the 48, with no other team having more than three.


Winning ugly is not easy and as good as the Magic are defensively, they still need to score to win. With their losses to the Pistons and Jazz last week, they’re 5-15 (1-9 in the last five weeks) when they’ve scored less efficiently than the league average (112.5 points per 100 possessions).


No Magic player has played in every game this season, but Kentavious Caldwell-Pope has played in 36 of 37. Over the 12 games without Wagner, Orlando has been 16.2 points per 100 possessions better with Caldwell-Pope on the floor (plus-2.0) than it’s been with him off the floor (minus-14.2).

Jimmy Butler lost his joy and the Heat lost to the Jazz … by 36 points … at home.
Three takeaways

Butler returned for two games and registered a usage rate of just 13.2% (ninth on the team) as the Heat split games against the Pelicans and Pacers. He didn’t play in the fourth quarter either night and then said that he doesn’t think he can rediscover his on-court “joy” in Miami. So the Heat suspended him for seven games (through their six-game trip that begins Monday) and said they’d listen to trade offers.


Butler’s teammates’ response was their worst loss of the season, a game in which they trailed the Jazz by 43 points. They’re now 5-6 without Butler and have been outscored by 2.2 points per 100 possessions in his 678 total minutes off the floor.


Rookie Kel’el Ware is getting some regular playing time and has almost as many points in three January games (47) as he had in 15 appearances through December (54). But Bam Adebayo was 0-for-6 from the floor on Saturday and has missed his last 17 3-point attempts. More concerning is that he has career-low marks in both 2-point percentage (49.9%) and free throw rate (32.5 attempts per 100 shots from the field).

The Heat now embark on their second six-game trip of the season, the start of a stretch where they’re playing 17 of 23 games on the road. They’ll have a rest advantage in Sacramento on Monday but will be at a disadvantage the following night in San Francisco.

The Spurs are three games into a stretch where they’re playing nine of 10 against teams currently over .500, and they’ve handled themselves well thus far, going 2-1 with the loss coming in overtime to the Nuggets on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Victor Wembanyama doesn’t yet have a go-to action for which the Spurs can get him a good shot on a big possession, and the clutch offense was pretty balanced (five guys attempting at least three clutch shots) as the Spurs played two nail-biters against Denver over the weekend. They scored just 23 points on 25 clutch possessions over the two games and have now lost four of their last five that were within five points in the last five minutes.


The Spurs rank second defensively over their last 10 games, creeping toward a top-10 mark for the season. The context is that six of those 10 games came against teams that currently rank in the bottom 10 offensively, but they were solid defensively against the Nuggets’ fourth-ranked offense over the weekend, holding Nikola Jokić under 50% shooting.


The Spurs have seen big improvement from last season regarding both opponent effective field goal percentage (both inside and out) and in opponent free throw rate. Over the first 50 seasons in which blocks had been tracked, the highest ratio of blocks/foul (for a player with at least 100 blocks) was Manute Bol’s ratio of 1.60 in 1986-87. Victor Wembanyama had a ratio of 1.66 as a rookie and is at 1.76 blocks per foul (116/66) this season, despite some foul trouble over the weekend.

The only below-.500 opponent in this stretch where the Spurs are playing nine of 10 against teams that have winning records is the Bulls, who the Spurs will visit on Monday, the start of a four-game trip. Their loss to Chicago in early December came without Wembanyama and was one of the Spurs’ worst defensive games of the season.

The Bucks got healthy last week (getting Giannis Antetokounmpo back from a four-game absence) and have the league’s easiest January schedule regarding cumulative opponent winning percentage. But they began the month with losses (at home) to the Nets and Blazers.
Three takeaways

Each of the Bucks’ last seven games have come against teams that currently rank in the bottom 10 defensively, but they’ve scored just 108.0 points per 100 possessions (seventh-worst) over that stretch. They were without Antetokounmpo and/or Damian Lillard for the first four of those games, but the offense hasn’t picked up with the stars’ return. Lillard has shot just 32% over his four games back, Taurean Prince has gone cold from beyond the arc, and the Bucks aren’t getting to the line, ranking 29th in free throw rate over the last 16 days.


The Bucks’ three games last week were the first three times that Antetokounmpo, Lillard and Khris Middleton have all been in the starting lineup, but the Bucks have scored a pretty anemic 101.9 points per 100 possessions in their 96 total minutes together.


They haven’t been losing by a lot. The Bucks’ last five games have all been within five points in the last five minutes, but they’ve scored just 32 points on 44 clutch possessions (0.73 per) over that stretch. Antetokounmpo has shot just 2-for-8 on clutch shots in his three games back, missing a contested layup for the lead with six seconds left against Brooklyn. Middleton has committed five clutch turnovers over the five-game stretch, and a Lillard-Bobby Portis miscommunication hurt them when they were down one in the closing seconds against Portland.

The Bucks will get another game against a bottom-10 defense, visiting the Raptors (26th) on Monday. Then they’ll play three straight against teams with winning records, currently just 3-8 within that group.

The Warriors are treading water, currently 3-2 on their six-game homestand, having survived another game (and improving to 5-2) without Stephen Curry.
Three takeaways

They’ll now have to survive some games without Jonathan Kuminga, who sprained his ankle in the Warriors’ win over Memphis on Saturday. Kuminga has been remarkably inconsistent and has still seen a big drop in efficiency from last season, but he was the Warriors’ leading scorer (22.7 points per game) on 54% shooting over the last seven games he played.


Moses Moody has also been on a hot streak, shooting 12-for-18 from 3-point range over the last four games. Dennis Schröder has made a few shots, Curry was 8-for-8 from beyond the arc against Philly, and Lindy Waters III was on a heater on Saturday. The Warriors’ first game of 2025 (a blowout win over the Sixers) was their most efficient offensive performance of the season, and their second game of the new year (the Curry-less victory over Memphis) wasn’t far behind.


With all that, the Warriors’ offense has still seen the league’s sixth-biggest drop in points scored per 100 possessions (-5.3) from last season. But they’ve played a relatively tough schedule and they’ll have a bunch of games against bottom-10 defenses between now and the All-Star break.

The Warriors have one game left on their first six-game homestand, but three left on their first stretch of five games in seven days, with a Central Division back-to-back on Thursday and Friday. They will have rest advantages against the Heat before they hit the road.

The Hawks have lost the first three games of the West portion of their road trip, falling to 5-11 against the opposite conference.
Three takeaways

The Hawks scored just 102.5 points per 100 possessions over the three losses, their worst three-game stretch of offense since before Thanksgiving. Their starting wings — Dyson Daniels and Zaccharie Risacher — shot just 4-for-25 from 3-point range, De’Andre Hunter (7-for-28 from the field over the two games in L.A.) may finally be cooling off, and Bogdan Bogdanović missed two of the three games.


They were also without Jalen Johnson (dealing with a shoulder issue) in two of three, and the Hawks have now been 15.6 points per 100 possessions better with Johnson on the floor (plus-2.6) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-13.0). That’s the fourth-biggest on-off differential among players who’ve played at least 500 minutes.


Their loss to the Clippers on Saturday was the third time that the Hawks have taken more than half of their shots from 3-point range. They’ve outscored their opponents from beyond the arc in five of their last seven games, as many times as they did in their first 29.

The Hawks are back at .500 for the fifth time this season, but the trip gets easier from here, with games against the Jazz and Suns (their first meetings with both teams) this week.

After losing their first game under Doug Christie, the Kings have won four straight for the first time this season.
Three takeaways

The Kings certainly benefited from opponents’ absences in the first three games of the winning streak. Dallas was without Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving, Philadelphia was without Joel Embiid, and Memphis was without Ja Morant. But, playing without De’Aaron Fox, they clobbered Golden State with Stephen Curry back in the lineup on Sunday, improving to 6-13 against the 10 teams ahead of them in the Western Conference standings.


With the context of all those absences, the winning streak has, statistically, been the Kings’ best four-game stretch of defense (107.3 points allowed per 100 possessions) since Games 3-6 of the season. They ranked third in both opponent turnover rate and defensive rebounding percentage last week. With that, they’ve climbed into the top five in shooting opportunity differential (plus-2.5 per game), though they’re not where they were last season (plus-3.2 per game, second).


Trey Lyles has also been on fire, shooting 12-for-20 from 3-point range during the win streak. He’s the backup center, but the Kings have also outscored their opponents by 14.5 points per 100 possessions in his 206 minutes alongside Domantas Sabonis.

The Kings have an East-heavy January schedule, now set to play their next four games against the opposite conference. They’ll host the Heat (with a rest disadvantage) on Monday, have three days off, and then head out on a three-game trip.

The Sixers went 4-2 on their first of two six-game road trips, but remain two games in the win column outside of the SoFi Play-In Tournament group in the Eastern Conference.
Three takeaways

The Sixers are no longer undefeated in games that Tyrese Maxey, Paul George and Joel Embiid have all been available for all four quarters, having suffered a wire-to-wire, 34-point loss at Golden State on Thursday. That was their worst defensive performance of the season (139 points allowed on 99 possessions), but it was followed by, statistically, their best defensive performance (94 allowed on 106 possessions in Brooklyn). That made them 6-1 when all three stars were available all night.


The offensive numbers when all three guys have been on the floor haven’t been great, but the Sixers have scored 115.9 points per 100 possessions over those seven games, with two of them (including their Christmas win in Boston) being two of the three times they’ve scored more than 120 per 100. Their win in Portland last Monday was the Sixers’ best offensive game of the season (125 on 97).


Embiid scored a season-high 37 points in that one, going 12-for-13 at the free-throw line. After registering a free throw rate of 44 attempts per 100 shots from the field through his first nine games, he’s at 65 per 100 over the last four. His 92% at the line is the best mark among 71 players with at least 100 attempts and the Sixers have outscored their opponents at the line in eight of his 10 games.

The Sixers will now play five of their next six games at home. The lone road game in that stretch (at Orlando on Sunday) feels like a pretty big one and will be the start of a stretch where they’re playing 11 of 14 against teams currently over .500.

The Pistons have won six of their last seven games to climb within a game of .500, but they lost Jaden Ivey to a broken fibula.
Three takeaways

Ivey was having his best stretch of the season when he suffered his injury, averaging 19.2 points on 60% shooting over his last five games. Overall, his improvement has been mostly from beyond the arc. He’s seen the league’s 10th biggest jump in 3-point percentage (from 33.6% to 40.9%) among 152 players with at least 100 3-point attempts in each of the last two seasons.


The much bigger difference between the Pistons’ wins and their losses has been on defense, and they were able to get a pair of ugly wins (over Orlando and Charlotte) last week. Overall, they’ve seen the league’s fifth-biggest drop in points allowed per 100 possessions (-4.8) from last season.


Turnovers were a big issue last season (when they ranked 29th in turnover differential) and through their first 27 games this season (2.7 per game more than their opponents). But the Pistons have committed fewer turnovers than their opponents in seven of their last eight games, having done so just seven times through their first 27.

The Pistons haven’t been above .500 since they were 2-1 (and about to begin a 27-game losing streak) at the start of last season, but they have a great opportunity to get there with games against Portland and Brooklyn early this week.

The Bulls are one of those teams that can lose to the Wizards by 18 points … and then beat the Knicks comfortably.
Three takeaways

The difference between those two games was on offense, where the Bulls scored just a point per possession in Washington, but had 139 on 106 (tied for their most efficient performance of the season) against New York. Both Zach LaVine and Coby White had 33 points and LaVine now has an effective field goal percentage of 61.1%, the best mark of his career and 11th best among 152 players with at least 250 field goal attempts. Nikola Vučević (62.8%) is one of the 10 guys ahead of him.


In general, the difference between wins (108.1 points allowed per 100 possessions) and losses (121.9 allowed per 100) has been more about the other end of the floor. Even with the win on Saturday and even though they rank second in 3-point rate, the Bulls have a losing record (10-11) when they’ve shot the league average (35.9%) or better from beyond the arc.


The Bulls are Team Drive and Kick. They rank seventh in drives per game (50.6%) and lead the league (by a healthy margin) in the percentage of drives (46.5%) on which they’ve passed. White, Josh Giddey and Ayo Dosunmu are three of the 13 players who’ve driven at least 200 times and passed on more than 50% of their drives.

The Bulls have only one homestand of more than three games. It’s a five-game stand where each game is against teams currently at or below .500, and it begins with a visit from the Wizards on Friday.

Devin Booker returned from a five-game absence last week, but the Suns’ slide has continued. They’ve lost seven of their last eight games and are 6-16 (only four teams have been worse) since mid-November.
Three takeaways

Defense has been the larger issue this season, but the Suns also rank just 24th offensively (108.7 points scored per 100 possessions) over this 1-7 stretch. Booker returned from his absence and shot just 4-for-20 against Memphis on Tuesday when the Suns also committed more than twice as many turnovers (17-8) as the Grizzlies. Grayson Allen also missed five straight games (before returning on Saturday) and has an effective field goal percentage of 54.7%, down from a career-best 64.9% last season.


The Suns are also losing the 3-point math again. After taking 46.4% of their shots from 3-point range (sixth highest) through their first 25 games, they’ve taken just 38.2% of their shots from deep (third lowest) over this 1-7 stretch, getting outscored by an average of 8.6 points per game from beyond the arc.


If this were college basketball and only games within the Western Conference counted in the Western Conference standings, the Suns would be 13-10 and tied for fifth place. But they’re just 2-8 against the East (having allowed 122.8 points per 100 possessions over those 10 games) after their loss in Indiana on Saturday, the start of a stretch where they’re playing 11 of 12 against the opposite conference.

This week also brings the Suns’ second stretch of five games in seven days, though the second games of the two back-to-backs are both against a team – the Hornets – that’s lost 10 straight. Phoenix is 1-5 (with five straight losses) in the second game of back-to-backs thus far.

The Nets managed to get a second win (though they almost blew a 21-point, fourth-quarter lead) in Milwaukee between blowout losses to Toronto and Philadelphia.
Three takeaways

D’Angelo Russell made his (second) Nets debut on Wednesday and has started the last two games. The Nets’ offense was better than average (113.7 points scored per 100 possessions) in his 68 minutes on the floor, but he suffered a shin contusion on Saturday, missing the second half of the loss to Philly.


The Nets were already without Cam Johnson (who’ll miss at least another two games), Cam Thomas (still dealing with the hamstring issue that had him out five weeks) and Ben Simmons, so there’s been plenty of playing time available for guys far down the cap sheet. They currently rank ninth in the percentage of their minutes (22%) that have come from rookies or second-year players, but that rate should climb in the next three months.


None of the young or modestly-paid players have been particularly efficient on the offensive end of the floor (where Brooklyn ranks 29th since Thanksgiving), but Noah Clowney (No. 21 pick in 2023) has been a little bit of a bright spot, shooting 39% from 3-point range. He’s taken 71% of his shots from beyond the arc, double the rate he had as a rookie.

With the losses to Toronto and Philly last week, the Nets are 4-6 in games played between the nine East teams currently at or below .500, a mark that includes a win over Indiana and a loss to Detroit. They’ll host the Pacers and Pistons this week before heading out on their longest road trip of the season (six games over 10 days).

The Blazers continue to get wins over good teams, picking up a clutch victory in Milwaukee on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Blazers’ 22 losses have been by an average of 18 points, while their 12 wins have been by an average of just 7.8. They’ve won four of their last five games that have been within five points in the last five minutes, scoring 45 points on 37 clutch possessions over that stretch. Anfernee Simons had the game-winning and-one on Saturday and is now an impressive 11-for-19 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime over the last three seasons.


Brook Lopez remains one of the league’s best rim protectors, but Shaedon Sharpe (who also had two big buckets down the stretch) had two impressive buckets against Lopez in drop coverage in the third quarter on Saturday. Sharpe has shot 59.6% in the paint, a big jump from last season (46.9%), but not quite as good as he shot in the paint as a rookie (60.9%).


The Blazers remain one of three teams in the bottom five on both ends of the floor, but they’re also one of only six teams that have scored more points per 100 possessions than they did last season (107.6, 29th).

The Jazz have won two straight games for the second time, with both streaks being consecutive road wins against the Eastern Conference.
Three takeaways

The Jazz still rank last defensively, but with their weekend wins in Miami and Orlando, they’ve allowed less than a point per possession more times this season (four) than they did all of last season (three). The Heat and Magic are both going through some struggles, but it’s not nothing that the Jazz didn’t allow either to break out of their slump.


Before Saturday, Brice Sensabaugh’s career high was 22 points. And then the 21-year-old scored 61 over the two weekend wins, shooting 12-for-17 from 3-point range. Only four of those 12 3-pointers were assisted, Sensabaugh is now 19-for-38 (50%) on pull-up 3s for the season, and he also had 12 points in the paint on Saturday. So he’s been creating some of his own offense.


John Collins had 29 points, nine rebounds and three blocks in the win in Miami, but was one of three vets — Jordan Clarkson and Lauri Markkanen were the others — that didn’t play the following night in Orlando. That was the Jazz’s first win (in seven games) without Collins, though they’re now 3-3 without Markkanen.

The Jazz are now 6-4 vs. the Eastern Conference, with all five of those wins having come on the road. They have five games left on a stretch where they’re playing 11 of 14 against the East, already holding wins over two of the teams — Miami and Brooklyn — that they’ll host this week.

Immanuel Quickley returned from a 22-game absence on Wednesday when the Raptors put an end to an 11-game losing streak with their fourth double-digit win of the season.
Three takeaways

The Raptors closed 2024 with the least efficient offensive performance for any team in the last three seasons, 71 points on 97 possessions (with just 13-for-38 shooting in the paint) in Boston on Tuesday. There have been five games this season where a team has shot worse than 35% in the paint, and the Raptors (2) and Suns (2) have accounted for two of the five.


Then they began 2025 with their most efficient performance of the season, 130 points on 98 possessions against Brooklyn. Scottie Barnes led the way with 33 points and has an effective field goal percentage of 56.5% over the last six games, up from just 49.6% before that. He’s still shooting just 29.3% from 3-point range (167th among 177 players with at least 100 attempts), but his 61.9% in the paint is the best mark of his career by a healthy margin.


Quickley has shot just 11-for-33 over his two games after almost two months off, but has 26 assists (to seven different teammates) and just four turnovers. He now has 11 games of double-digit assists in 43 total games with the Raptors, having had four in 266 games (including playoffs) with the Knicks.

Quickley, Barnes and RJ Barrett (out the last three games) have yet to play together this season, but that should happen this week as the Raptors continue a stretch where they’re playing 12 of 15 games against teams that currently have winning records. Barrett is listed as questionable for their game against the Bucks on Monday.

After losing 11 straight games (10 of them against teams currently at or below .500), the Pelicans swept their home-and-home set with the Wizards.
Three takeaways

The offense was improving at the end of the losing streak and the last five games (116.7 points scored per 100 possessions) have been the Pelicans’ best stretch on that end of the floor this season. CJ McCollum has averaged 32.4 points on an effective field goal percentage of 68.5% over that stretch, with his 50 on Friday tying his career high. He’s shot just 39.0% from mid-range this season, but his 57.5% in the paint is the best mark of his career.


Though Trey Murphy III shot just 5-for-19 in the first win over the Wizards, he’s been terrific otherwise, averaging 24.7 points over the last nine games. But he turned his left ankle (again) in the third quarter on Sunday.


The win on Sunday was also the first time the Pelicans have held their opponent under a point per possession, leaving the Wizards themselves as the only team that hasn’t done so this season. The defense has been at its best (112.4 points allowed per 100 possessions — a tick better than the league average) with Herb Jones on the floor, and the Pelicans (who are 7-29) have been outscored by just six total points in Jones’ 598 total minutes.

The Pelicans are 1-2 vs. Portland, allowing 128.6 points per 100 possessions in the two losses. The final meeting is Wednesday, when the Pelicans will be at a rest disadvantage, having hosted the Wolves 24 hours earlier.

The Wizards’ first game of 2025 was their most comfortable win of the season, an 18-point victory over the Bulls. But they lost both games of the home-and-home set between the last-place teams in each conference.
Three takeaways

The win over Chicago was the Wizards’ best 3-point shooting game (17-for-36, 47%) since October, and Jordan Poole (6-for-13) led the way. He’s accounted for 42.4% of the Wizards’ 3-pointers when he’s been on the floor, up from 30.7% last season and a rate that ranks second among 308 players who’ve played at least 300 minutes.


Poole missed Sunday’s loss with a hip contusion and, over the two-game set against the Pelicans (one of four teams with a worse 3-point differential than Washington), the Wizards were outscored by 48 points from beyond the arc. They’re now 1-22 (only the 0-13 Hornets have been worse) when getting outscored from 3-point range.


Kyle Kuzma returned from a 12-game absence last week, shooting 24-for-34 (71%) inside the arc over his four games back, and scoring a season-high 28 points in the Poole-less loss to New Orleans on Sunday. He’s still played just 35 total minutes alongside veterans Malcolm Brogdon and Jonas Valančiūnas.

The Wizards’ first stretch of five games in seven days begins with a visit from the Rockets on Tuesday. Washington will be at a rest disadvantage in Philadelphia the following night when it will try to end a 22-game losing streak in the second game of back-to-backs.

Ball and Miller returned on Sunday when they combined for 48 points in Cleveland and were on the floor with Mark Williams for just the third time this season. He was a plus-12 (finishing with 20 points, 12 rebounds, two steals and three blocks) against Chicago last Monday, but Charlotte remains winless (0-12) with Williams in uniform, so he hasn’t been part of a victory in almost 13 months (since Dec. 8, 2023).


The Hornets currently rank fifth in the percentage of their minutes (29%) that have come from rookies or second-year players. K.J. Simpson (the 42nd pick in last year’s Draft) has recently replaced Isaiah Wong as the two-way guard getting rotation minutes and had a fun sequence last Monday where he had two buckets (and a steal) in three seconds.

Having played 30 of their first 34 games within the Eastern Conference, the Hornets will now play 10 of their next 11 against the West. They’ll have a rest advantage against the Suns on Tuesday but will begin a five-game trip in L.A. two nights later.

None of the Utah Jazz's higher-profile draft picks from the post-Rudy Gobert/Donovan Mitchell era have shown much (or any) star upside. That has to be a bummer for Jazz fans, and it should help anyone on the outside understand why they want their team to lose so much this year.
This season marks their best chance during this rebuild for a potentially franchise-altering talent. But in the meantime, even if none of the young guys look like future All-Stars, Utah faithful can take solace in the fact that one of their later picks looks like a solid role player at the very least.

The Charlotte Hornets aren't just jumping the Utah Jazz because they closed out their week with a victory over them (although that's part of it). The real reason it feels right to have Charlotte a bit higher is the presence of LaMelo Ball on the roster.
There's a real discussion over the value of his production on a losing team, whether he makes teammates better and if he's shooting too much. But the nitpicking may also be shortchanging him a bit.
Nikola Jokić and Trae Young are the only players in the league averaging more ""points plus points generated by assists"" per game. He's also on pace to become the 14th player in NBA history to average at least 29 points and seven assists for a season (assuming Jokić stays clear of those thresholds as well).
Ball is a superstar. Or he has the potential to be, at the very least. The Jazz don't have anyone like that on their roster."

And if they keep losing while Scoot Henderson offers some reasons for hope in his career, even better.
After spending most of his first two seasons as one of the NBA's least efficient scorers (he's 124th in true shooting percentage among the 124 players with at least 1,000 shot attempts over the last two years), Henderson erupted for 39 in the loss to the Nets."

Toward the end of the calendar year, it was starting to look like the Philadelphia 76ers' slow start wouldn't matter. Being in the Eastern Conference allows for a significantly larger margin for error, and the Sixers were charging back into the playoff (or at least play-in) picture.
But Joel Embiid is out again (this time with a foot injury), and Philadelphia is 2-7 in January. They've lost four straight, three of which were at home. And they're now two games behind the Bulls for the 10th seed.
If there are silver linings, one is just being in the East. Despite being nine games under .500, they're only two games out of a play-in spot with over half of the season to play. The other is that Paul George may finally be finding some rhythm, even if the team can't find its own.
This month, PG is averaging 22.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 3.7 threes per game while shooting 44.1 percent from deep."

As we approach the Feb. 6 NBA trade deadline, you're likely to hear a lot more rumors about Zach LaVine and his potential destinations in a trade. The Chicago Bulls should be chasing better odds in the draft lottery, and the presence of LaVine is hurting on that front.
When you account for both accuracy and volume, LaVine has arguably been the league's best three-point shooter to this point in the season.

The Phoenix Suns were in desperate need of a stretch against some of the league's tanking teams, and they just ended it with a seven-point win over the Washington Wizards on Thursday.
The Suns' last seven games were against the Philadelphia 76ers without Joel Embiid, the Charlotte Hornets, the Atlanta Hawks, the Utah Jazz, the Hornets again, the Hawks again and then the Wizards.
While they went 5-2 during that run, it's far from encouraging. One of the losses came to Charlotte. The wins over Utah, Charlotte and Washington were all by single digits. And Phoenix's net rating against bottom-10 teams ranks 19th.
This week's acquisition of center Nick Richards may signal to fans that the organization is still trying to win and improve in the short term, but that move isn't likely to have a dramatic impact on any of the above."

The team's point differential is dramatically better when he's on the floor, thanks in large part to him having one of the best high-volume three-point shooting seasons of all time.
No, seriously.
Beasley is averaging 4.9 made threes per 75 possessions. Only Stephen Curry (who's cleared that mark six times, including 2024-25), Steve Novak (2011-12) and Sam Merrill (2023-24) have seasons with more threes per 75 possessions."

But their outlook, at least if you ever considered them a title contender, remains bleak.
The Warriors are 10-18 since a 10-2 start. They have a point differential around that of a 24-win team when Stephen Curry is off the floor. And both Curry and Draymond Green have publicly signaled that they aren't interested in win-now trades that would compromise the organization's post-Curry future.
Barring a midseason star leap from Jonathan Kuminga or an out-of-left-field trade, it's hard to imagine this team being much better than mediocre."

He's still having a positive impact, as evidenced by his average of 5.0 blocks and positive plus-minus in these five contests, but a more concerted effort to score inside the three-point line could make the cold shooting streaks easier for San Antonio to survive."

But in recent weeks, Young is starting to look more like his old self as a shooter. Over his last 15 games, he's at 26.5 points and 3.5 threes per game with a 39.8 three-point percentage.
If he can keep this up after Hunter and Johnson return to the rotation (both have missed recent games with injuries), Atlanta could become one of the tougher offenses in the league to stop."

Bam Adebayo is having a down year on offense, but he remains a legitimate defensive anchor.

And this current run may have as much to do with the reemergence of third-year forward Keegan Murray as it does Christie.

The Los Angeles Lakers are prone to serious lapses, as evidenced by their bottom-10 net rating and this week's surrender of a double-digit second-half lead against the San Antonio Spurs, but they still have the ceiling of a potential top-six team in the West.
LeBron James' trust in Austin Reaves' playmaking is a big part of that.
Reaves had 14 assists in Wednesday's win over the Miami Heat, bringing his average to 9.6 over his last nine games. Over the entire season, L.A. is 4-2 when he gets to at least 10 dimes."

The Indiana Pacers are surging up the Eastern Conference standings. They're 7-1 in their last eight games, with the only loss coming against the Cleveland Cavaliers (they also beat the Cavs in this stretch). Perhaps even more impressive, they're 13-4 in their last 17 games.
And while Tyrese Haliburton's return to All-NBA form is certainly a big part of the turnaround, unsung hero Andrew Nembhard deserves a shout, too.
The team is 18-9 when he's available, and he leads the Pacers in net-rating swing (the difference between a team's net points per 100 possessions when a given player is on or off the floor).
When Nembhard is playing, Indiana is plus-10.4 points per 100 possessions, compared to minus-5.5 when he isn't.
Decent scoring and another outside shooting threat are certainly part of that impact, but his playmaking may be most important. Having another facilitator to take some attention and responsibility from Haliburton has loosened things up on that end, and Nembhard is averaging 5.0 assists."

The further we get into the 2024-25 campaign, the clearer it is that the Karl-Anthony Towns trade was a significant misstep for the Minnesota Timberwolves unless this apparent departure from title contention justified getting out of KAT's contract.
While Towns continues to build a fringe MVP case with the New York Knicks, the Wolves' point differential is worse when Julius Randle is on the floor. Rudy Gobert's fit is trickier without KAT's outside shooting to space the floor for him.
The Wolves' record reflects all of that. They have never been more than three wins clear of .500 this season."

The Denver Nuggets can't seem to maintain any momentum.
A nagging calf injury that's kept Aaron Gordon out for more than half of the team's games is certainly a factor. Nikola Jokić now having missed six games hasn't helped, either. The latest was a late surprise on Wednesday, when Jokić was scratched ahead of a loss to the Houston Rockets with elbow inflammation.
But even if the Nuggets aren't likely to threaten last season's total of 57 wins, there are some positive signs shining through the inconsistency and unavailability of some of their most important players.
Denver is 8-3 in its last 11. And Jamal Murray, who dropped a season-high 45 points on the Dallas Mavericks this week, is averaging 21.9 points, 5.8 assists and 2.5 threes while shooting 45.3 percent from three over his last 17 games."

The New York Knicks have cooled way off in January. Even after beating the Joel Embiid-less Philadelphia 76ers in overtime on Wednesday, they're now only 4-5 this month.

Ja Morant has missed 17 games, and he's averaging fewer than 30 minutes per game for the first time in his career. That and a breakout campaign from Jaren Jackson Jr. have perhaps muted the reaction to the season Morant is having.

Ja is averaging 25.4 points and 8.9 assists per 75 possessions. When the Grizzlies inevitably ramp him up in the playoffs, they could be one of the toughest outs in the league."

And while it's a stingy, top-three defense that's most responsible for Houston being in second place in the tougher conference, the oft-nitpicked Jalen Green is starting to break out on the other end.

It's probably fair to keep thinking that the Boston Celtics are merely in cruise control. They'll almost certainly hit another gear in the postseason.
But their latest loss, which came Wednesday against the way-below-.500 Toronto Raptors, makes them 7-7 in their last 14 games and puts them 6.5 games back of the first-place Cleveland Cavaliers.
Home-court advantage in the Finals isn't as likely for the Celtics as it was last season. It's now looking like they might not even have it in the conference finals (if they even get that far).
It makes sense to conserve some energy in the regular season, but that approach eventually stung last year's reigning champions (the Denver Nuggets). If the Celtics don't rediscover the hunger they exhibited throughout 2023-24, someone might catch them in the playoffs, too."

OKC is on pace for 70 wins. They have a better net rating (by a lot) than the 73-win Golden State Warriors.

Williamson appeared to be in good shape, was explosive and had 22 points, four assists and three steals in 28 minutes.
And though it's probably too late for some kind of furious, Zion-led rally back into the play-in mix (New Orleans lost his one game back from injury), it should be encouraging to at least see the 2019 No. 1 overall pick in action.

The latest slide has Atlanta back to .500, with a bottom-10 net rating and mediocre marks in both offensive and defensive ratings.
The glass-half-full view includes the fact that Jalen Johnson has missed four of these five games. His finishing alongside Young is a big part of why he has the biggest net-rating impact of anyone on the team. Atlanta is plus-2.6 points per 100 possessions with Johnson on the floor and minus-11.7 when he's off.
The more pessimistic, and perhaps more important take is that the Hawks won't be able to find long-term offensive consistency until Young starts consistently hitting shots. After going 6-of-15 in Thursday's loss, Young has hit fewer than half his shot attempts in 29 of his 36 appearances."

Now, those wins came against the Dallas Mavericks without Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving, the Philadelphia 76ers without Joel Embiid, the Memphis Grizzlies without Ja Morant, the reeling Golden State Warriors and the Miami Heat without Jimmy Butler. And four of the five were at home.
It's pretty easy to nitpick the turnaround.
But that point differential is a season-long number. They've likely been better than their record suggests for a while.

Jokić isn't leaving the ""best in the world"" conversation any time soon, but the game still almost felt a bit like a passing of the torch.
Over the rest of the week, though, San Antonio went 0-3 (including a loss on the second leg of its home-and-home with Jokić and the Nuggets). And Wemby shot worse than 50 percent from the field in each of those three losses.
He's ascending faster than even the most optimistic prognosticators could've imagined before his rookie campaign in 2023-24. As a sophomore, he is already arguably playing like a top 5-10 player in the league.

Kawhi Leonard's current minutes restriction could delay our ability to draw some real takeaways from his return. It's hard to get into a rhythm in 20 minutes, especially if you're a career starter who's mostly been a first option.
So, Kawhi being 2-of-12 on two-pointers in his two games isn't a cause for concern. What's more important is that he's back and he's given us occasional glimpses of his old self (especially when he's outside the three-point line).
If, by the end of the campaign, L.A. is reliably getting 30-plus minutes per game from Leonard and still getting the playmaking of James Harden, the outside shooting of Norman Powell and the defensive tenacity of Derrick Jones Jr., Kris Dunn and Nicolas Batum, it could be a postseason spoiler."

This campaign has been a bit of a roller coaster for the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the last few weeks are no exception.
Over their last 12 games, they lost three in a row, won three in a row, lost three in a row and now, they're once again on a three-game winning streak.
Finding some semblance of consistency is the next step for Minnesota, and it may have already found the fix.
Donte DiVincenzo has been in the starting five in each of the last three wins, and the added three-point volume seems to be helping.
With DiVincenzo on the floor, defenders have to sell out a bit more aggressively to the three-point line, giving Julius Randle and Anthony Edwards precious extra space to attack."

Despite how dominant he's been this season, he can't singlehandedly save the team from its occasional bouts of mediocrity on both ends of the floor. At least not every night.
Wednesday, he dropped 25 points, 16 rebounds and eight assists against Victor Wembanyama, but he also got plenty of help from his supporting cast in that win. Brook Lopez (22) and Damian Lillard (26) each eclipsed 20 points, while Gary Trent Jr. and A.J. Green both scored in double figures off the bench."

It's been an eventful week for the Denver Nuggets that started with a home-and-away back-to-back with the San Antonio Spurs.
They went 1-1 in those contests, which featured what might already be the game's best big-man battle: Nikola Jokić vs. Victor Wembanyama.
And while those two contests, in which Jokić averaged 43.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, 9.5 assists, 2.0 steals and 1.0 blocks, would have given more than enough fodder for this write-up, an even more important take materialized in the second half of the week.
The reigning MVP missed Denver's Tuesday-Wednesday back-to-back with an illness. And despite dropping one of those games, it was likely the most impressive stretch the non-Jokić Nuggets have had all season.
First, their effort on defense and increased three-point volume helped them stay competitive with the Boston Celtics for three quarters. Then on Wednesday, they blew out the Los Angeles Clippers in a game in which they went 17-of-35 from three.
If Denver maintains the kind of defensive effort and focus on getting threes up that it showed this week after Jokić returns, it could start looking like a title contender again."

After steamrolling most of the NBA throughout 2023-24 and into the first few weeks of this season, the Boston Celtics have quietly looked mortal of late.
They ended their week with a road win over the Nikola Jokić-less Denver Nuggets, but that one was more competitive than expected. And since they beat the Bucks in early December to move to 19-4, Boston is 8-6 in its last 14.
And perhaps most notably during that stretch, the Celtics were throttled by an Oklahoma City Thunder defense that held them to 92 points this week.
Of course, that was the third game of a tough Western Conference road trip. And it's fair to wonder if the reigning champions are just in cruise control ahead of the postseason.

They have the fourth-best point differential in NBA history, behind only the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers, the 1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks and the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls. And they're on pace for what would be a record-tying 73 wins.
Now, are the Cavs likely to maintain this pace all season? Of course not.

Even in the softer Eastern Conference, where the 10th-place team is currently six games below .500, Philadelphia is still outside of the play-in picture. If Embiid is going to remain a part-time player, it's going to be hard for the Sixers to break in.
Even if they do, and then they escape the play-in, they'd have to face a team with far more continuity (like the Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics or New York Knicks) in the first round.
At this point, given that they owe their 2025 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder if it falls outside of the top six, it might make more sense for Philly to reboot the process and tank this season."

One night later, Post played 20 minutes off the bench, had 20 points and went 5-of-10 from deep. And his sudden emergence could help the Warriors in a couple of different ways.
If Golden State is hesitant to mortgage its future for a win-now deal, as Stephen Curry has suggested it should be, Post's outside shooting could help space the floor for the team's wings and guards.

Their net rating suggests they should be a bit better, but the Minnesota Timberwolves have spent the bulk of this season as the league's picture of mediocrity. In fact, they've been within three games of a .500 record for the entirety of this campaign.
The reason for that may be the lack of a superstar leap that so many expected from Anthony Edwards. His basic numbers (26.2 points, 4.3 assists and 4.2 threes per game) are impressive, but he's not really elevating teammates, and advanced numbers don't grade him much higher than a top-30 performer in 2024-25.
A renewed commitment to defense and a better assist-to-turnover ratio—he's averaging a career-high 3.4 giveaways per game—might help Minnesota finally get some traction."

The Indiana Pacers were blown out by the San Antonio Spurs in a showcase game in France on Thursday, but that shouldn't be cause for much concern.
Generally speaking, things are trending in the right direction.
Indiana had won eight of nine prior to that meeting with the Spurs. And the turnaround is the product of a deep, balanced offensive attack.
Since January 2, when a six-game winning streak started, Pascal Siakam, Tyrese Haliburton, Myles Turner and Bennedict Mathurin have all averaged over 15 points. Four more rotation players are over seven points per game in that stretch. And Haliburton, Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell are. at 9.2, 5.6 and 4.9 assists, respectively."

Things went from bad to worse for the reigning Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks this week.

But Kyrie Irving and this merry band of three-and-D role players have done what they can to keep the team afloat, Luka's return shouldn't be too far off and the team just upset the Oklahoma City Thunder (in OKC).

They ended their week with a loss to the red-hot Denver Nuggets on Thursday, but the Sacramento Kings had won 10 of 11 prior to that. And they're now very much back in the mix for a top-six seed in the West.
And during that stretch, their starting five was genuinely dominant.
In those 11 games, DeMar DeRozan (24.1 points), De'Aaron Fox (22.8), Malik Monk (22.3) and Domantas Sabonis (20.9) were all over 20 points per game. Monk (7.5 assists), Sabonis (6.5) and Fox (6.1) all averaged over six assists. And perhaps most encouraging, Keegan Murray, who's struggled with his outside shot for most of the season, hit 38.6 percent of his threes.
It's not realistic to expect that kind of production from the starters for the rest of the season. Monk and Fox were both held in check by Denver on Thursday. But if they can collectively be near that level, they'll be one of the tougher outs in the conference."

The Los Angeles Clippers nipped a little losing streak in the bud at two games, when they blew the Washington Wizards out on Thursday.
And in that game, James Harden had 17 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds, while Kawhi Leonard was plus-23 in 24 minutes.
Seeing the latter in action, even if there is some rust (he had more shots than points on Thursday) makes it pretty easy to buy this team as a potential spoiler in the West.
In the weeks and months leading up to Kawhi's return, Harden showed he can still be a bona fide offensive engine. Norman Powell has more than made up for the loss of Paul George's scoring. And the rest of the defense-heavy supporting cast looks to fit the stars well.
As Leonard gets up to speed, the Clippers are going to become one of the league's toughest nightly matchups."

Seven of the victories came against teams that are currently .500 or worse, but the Milwaukee Bucks have won eight of their last nine, and stretches like this against the softer portions of a schedule can be good for establishing a rhythm.

There are reasonable gripes about Tom Thibodeau's rotations, the size of the trade package to land Mikal Bridges and the size and length of OG Anunoby's new contract.
The New York Knicks have each of the top three, four of the top five and five of the top 23 players in total minutes this season. The Bridges deal cost New York four unprotected first-round picks, a first-round pick swap and one protected first-rounder. And Anunoby is under contract through 2028-29, when he has a $48.4 million player option.
But New York also made two of the shrewder moves in recent history by landing Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns, who now make up one of the league's best duos.
Brunson is averaging 26.0 points, 7.3 assists and 2.3 threes while shooting 39.1 percent from deep. KAT is at 25.1 points, a career-high 13.9 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.1 threes with a 43.3 three-point percentage.

It was his fifth straight triple-double, and he reached each one before the start of the fourth quarter.
Plenty in the media and around the internet seem to think a Shai Gilgeous-Alexander MVP is a foregone conclusion (he's still a huge favorite in the betting market), but Jokić is averaging a 30-point triple-double and is on track to break his own single-season record for box plus/minus (""...a basketball box score-based metric that estimates a basketball player's contribution to the team when that player is on the court."").

It's officially fair to be at least a little concerned about the Boston Celtics.

They're now 5-5 in their last 10 and 10-9 in their last 19.
Of course, this may just be a classic case of a reigning champion heading through the regular season in cruise control, but the team three-point percentage being over two points lower than it was in 2023-24 is notable. Derrick White and Jrue Holiday both dropping a little closer to their career norms from deep could mean something, too.

The Thunder got revenge on the Cavs and then some, leading by as many as 42 points on Thursday.
Three takeaways

The Thunder were without Isaiah Hartenstein on Thursday (and over the weekend), but they didn’t have to worry much about rebounding, because they forced 21 turnovers, including 13 on 52 possessions in the first half. They continue to have the best turnover differential (-6.5 per game) in the 48 seasons for which turnovers have been counted, having committed fewer than their opponent in 37 of their 42 games.


In addition to scoring 22 points on Thursday, Lu Dort helped keep Donovan Mitchell under wraps for the second time. Mitchell’s 6-for-31 (19%) shooting against the Thunder is the third-worst mark for any player with at least 25 field goal attempts vs. a single opponent this season, and he had just six free throw attempts over the two games as well. Opponents have shot just 40.9% on shots Dort has defended, by far his best mark in the last five seasons.


The night after clobbering the Cavs, the Thunder lost in Dallas without Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. It was the first game he’s missed and their worst offensive game (98 points on 96 possessions) since early November. They’ve now scored 15.9 more points per 100 possessions with Gilgeous-Alexander on the floor (120.1) than they have with him off the floor (104.2).

With the Thunder a little banged up, it’s good news that they’ll play only four games over the next 12 days, with two of those four against the Jazz and Blazers. With their win over Brooklyn on Sunday, the Thunder are 12-0 (with an average point differential of 21.4 points per game) against the bottom nine teams in the league.

The Cavs got clobbered in their rematch with the Thunder but beat two other good teams on their three-game trip.
Three takeaways

The Cavs are the 15th team in NBA history (first since the 2019-20 Bucks) to win at least 35 of their first 41 games. Nine of the previous 14 (but only three of the last seven) reached the NBA Finals, with eight of those nine winning the championship.


The Cavs’ issues in Oklahoma City began with their 21 turnovers, which affected the other side of the floor. But there’s been some defensive slippage beyond that over the last couple of weeks, as they’ve allowed 120.9 points per 100 possessions over their last six games. The defense has been OK in 74 minutes with Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen playing together (113.3 allowed per 100), but they’ve allowed 125.2 per 100 in 171 minutes over that stretch with only one of the two bigs on the floor.


They still improved to 3-0 without Mobley with their win in Minnesota on Saturday, when bench minutes were huge. They took control with a 26-5 run spanning the third and fourth quarters, improving to 8-6 in games they’ve trailed by double-digits and handing the Wolves their second-worst defensive performance of the season.

Having split their two games against the first-place team in the West, the Cavs will now play two against the second-place team. Their second game against the Rockets (Saturday in Cleveland) is also the second game of the Cavs’ only stretch of five games in seven days.

The Rockets dropped a rest-disadvantage game in Sacramento on Thursday, but won their two more important games last week, including one that clinched a tie-breaker with the third-place Grizzlies.
Three takeaways

With their wins over the Grizzlies and Nuggets (in Denver) last week, the Rockets have the best record (11-2) in games played between the seven Western Conference teams that are more than two games over .500, with both losses having come to the Thunder. They’ve been better offensively in those 13 games (116.7 points scored per 100 possessions) than they’ve been otherwise.


The offense has been terrific over the last 15 days in general. Having scored 124.9 points per 100 possessions (best in the league) over their last seven games, the Rockets have climbed from 14th to ninth on offense. They’re now one of four teams in the top 10 on both ends and one of only seven that have scored more points per 100 possessions than they did last season (113.7, 20th).


The offensive surge starts with Jalen Green, who’s averaged 31.3 points on 55/54/94 shooting splits over this seven-game stretch. But it’s also important that Fred VanVleet has seemingly found his shot. His season-long 3-point percentage (33.2%) is still the worst mark of his career, but he’s 12-for-25 (48%) from beyond the arc over his last four games.

After they host the Pistons on Monday, the Rockets will begin a stretch where they’re playing five of seven games against the Cavs (x 2), Celtics, Grizzlies and Knicks, with four of those five on the road.

The Celtics remain in a (relative) funk, alternating wins and losses over their last eight games.
Three takeaways

The nadir for the Celtics was probably their loss in Toronto on Wednesday when they scored just 97 points on 94 possessions against the league’s 28th-ranked defense. Their issues have started with their offense, and it hasn’t been solely about 3-point shooting. The Celtics shot just 20-for-39 (51%) in the paint in Toronto and just 21-for-42 (50%) in the paint in their overtime loss to the Hawks over the weekend.


The Celtics still rank fifth in field goal percentage in the paint for the season (60.0%), but are last (by a wide margin) in the percentage of their shots that have come in the paint (39%). That rate has been a little higher (40%) but is still last in the league over the eight weeks since Kristaps Porziņģis made his season debut.


Their one win last week did come with the most efficient offensive performance (121 points on only 90 possessions) that the Magic’s third-ranked defense has allowed this season by a wide margin. Jaylen Brown had six assists that night and another eight in the Celtics’ loss to Atlanta. His scoring efficiency is down, but he’s seen a big jump in assist ratio (career-high 16.7 per 100 possessions used) from last season (13.9).

The Celtics will play nine of their next 12 games on the road, starting a four-game trip in Golden State on Monday afternoon. They blew a seven-point, fourth-quarter lead in a loss to the Warriors early in the season.

The Grizzlies lost a huge game in Houston last Monday (falling to 0-3 vs. the second-place Rockets), blowing a 13-point, fourth-quarter lead. But they remain in the top three in the West, having swept a two-game series in San Antonio.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies are the second team to match its win total from last season (27-55), not a big surprise given the circumstances. But statistically, (+7.5 points per 100 possessions), this would also be the best team in franchise history. They’re not on pace to match their franchise high of 56 wins, but they have the point differential of a team that’s 32-10, with 10 of their last 12 losses having been by single digits.


The Grizzlies’ when-healthy starting lineup continues to have dominant numbers (plus-38.1 points per 100 possessions), but has still played just 76 total minutes, because of limited availability and limited minutes (9.5 per game) when they’re all in uniform. Memphis’ bench ranks third, with one key ingredient being Jake LaRavia (averaging 22 minutes), who’s seen big jumps in scoring efficiency, rebounding percentage and assist ratio in his third season.


Ja Morant (sore foot) missed the second of the Grizzlies’ two wins in San Antonio, what was the team’s most efficient offensive performance of the season (140 points on 101 possessions). Overall, Memphis has almost identical numbers in the games Morant has played vs. the games he hasn’t, with the strength of schedule (cumulative opponent winning percentage) having also been about the same …

The Nuggets dropped a rest-disadvantage game (without Nikola Jokić) to the Rockets on Wednesday, but remain in the top four in the West, having won 10 of their last 13 games.
Three takeaways

The Nuggets have the league’s No. 1 offense (121.9 points scored per 100 possessions) since the day after Christmas. That stretch includes some big offensive games against top 10 defenses (those of the Clippers and Heat). All five of their current starters have averaged at least 13.3 points over that stretch, combining for an effective field goal percentage of 59.7%.


It wasn’t long ago that we were worrying about Jamal Murray, who scored 45 points (on 18-for-26 shooting) in the Nuggets’ win in Dallas on Tuesday. His effective field goal percentage of 52.1% would still be the lowest mark in his last four seasons, but he’s at 56.1% since Christmas and was 21-for-42 on pull-up jumpers over the Nuggets’ four games last week.


The Nuggets continue to rank last in 3-point rate (34.5% of their shots) for the second straight season and by a healthy margin. (They’ve seen a drop in each of the last three seasons.) They also still rank in the top five in 3-point percentage, having shot 43-for-91 (47%) over a three-game stretch last week. Their win in Miami on Friday came with their biggest 3-point differential of the season (plus-21) and a ridiculous no-look, over-the-head dime from Jokić to Aaron Gordon.

Their loss to the Rockets on Wednesday was just the Nuggets’ first defeat in eight rest-disadvantage games. They’ve had just two rest-advantage games (2-0) all season, with that (six more) being the league’s biggest differential. They’ll narrow that gap in the next several weeks, starting with an advantage game against the Kings on Thursday.

The Knicks haven’t been able to take advantage of the Celtics’ slide, because they’re just 3-6 over the last 2 1/2 weeks.
Three takeaways

Over the last eight days, Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart have returned from the locker room after suffering scary-looking shoulder injuries. But Karl-Anthony Towns missed the last two games with a thumb sprain. Having split the two, the Knicks are 4-3 when one of their five starters hasn’t been available.


The Knicks were pretty efficient in their overtime win in Philadelphia, just the 13th OT game in 29 seasons of play-by-play data in which one team never led. But they shot just 39% against the Wolves on Friday, with a big difference being Brunson’s shooting inside the arc (11-for-16 in Philly, 6-for-16 vs. Minnesota). For the season, they’ve been outscored by 7.2 points per 100 possessions (scoring just 108.2 per 100) in 216 total minutes with the other four starters on the floor without Towns.


Defense was the issue down the stretch against Detroit last Monday, and the Pistons put the game away by targeting Brunson in the pick-and-roll, with his man setting screens for Cade Cunningham and the results being two wide-open, weak-side 3s for Malik Beasley. The Wolves also came out of a fourth-quarter timeout looking to get Brunson switched onto Anthony Edwards. According to Second Spectrum tracking, opponents have set 10.0 ball screens per 100 possessions with Brunson’s defender this season, up from 5.4 per 100 last season.

The Knicks still have seven games left on a stretch where they’re playing 12 of 14 at home, and the one road game this week is just across the river, though they’ll be at a rest disadvantage in Brooklyn on Tuesday.

The Pacers couldn’t get the home-and-home sweep of the Cavs, but they still have the league’s third-best record (14-4) over the last 5 1/2 weeks.
Three takeaways

The Pacers’ improvement from their first 25 games to their last 18 has been about even on both ends of the floor, with the defensive improvement the more surprising. The Pacers rank fifth defensively over the 14-4 stretch, with eight of the 18 games having come against teams that currently rank in the top 10 offensively.


They’ve benefitted from their opponents shooting just 32.8% from 3-point range over the 18 games, without an increase in the percentage that have been contested, according to Second Spectrum tracking. But they’ve also seen a drop in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (from 59.9% to 56.2%) and a jump in defensive rebounding percentage.


Aaron Nesmith returned from a 35-game absence on Thursday and shot 7-for-9 over his two games back. After one game as a starter (with Bennedict Mathurin serving a one-game suspension), Nesmith came off the bench on Saturday, when the starting lineup (still one of the best in the league) struggled a bit and the Pacers outscored the Sixers by 19 points in a little more than 36 minutes with at least one reserve on the floor.

The Pacers now head to Paris for two games against the Spurs, currently 9-4 (second best in the East) against the Western Conference.

After a 1-4 stretch, the Clippers have won four straight games to climb back into the top five in the West.
Three takeaways

The Clippers have allowed just 91.5 points per 100 possessions over the winning streak. That’s somewhat skewed by Brooklyn scoring 67 points on 96 possessions on Wednesday. (That was the least efficient game for any team — regular season or playoffs — in the last six seasons.) But, they also held the Heat and Blazers under a point per possession last week. They’ve now held their opponent under a point per possession 11 times they’ve held their opponent under a point per possession, two more times than they did all of last season (nine).


Kawhi Leonard sat out the Clippers’ win in Portland on Thursday (the second game of a back-to-back), but scored 42 points in 48 minutes over their wins over the Nets and Lakers. He shot 17-for-24 (16-for-20 inside the arc) over the two games and the Clippers have now outscored their opponents by 73 points (31.3 per 100 possessions) in his 109 minutes this season.


Derrick Jones Jr. is back in the starting lineup, with the Brooklyn win being the first time in more than two months that Kris Dunn came off the bench. The latter is a terrific defender, but Jones gives the Clippers more size and Dunn has shot just 15-for-57 (26%) on corner 3-pointers, the second-worst mark among 80 players who’ve attempted at least 50.

The Clippers have won 15 of their last 17 games at the Intuit Dome and, with the rescheduling of a handful of games due to the wildfires in Los Angeles, their four-game homestand has become a five-game homestand. But the first four games of it (starting with their win over the Lakers on Sunday) is now the league’s only stretch of four games in five days. They’re 8-1 against the Eastern Conference, with the one loss (by 32 points) having come to the Celtics, who they’ll host on Wednesday.

The Wolves remain amazingly inconsistent. They got a big win in New York on Friday, which was sandwiched by losses at home to the Warriors and Cavs.
Three takeaways

The win in New York was the Wolves’ best 3-point shooting game of the season (22-for-40), but the inconsistency is almost completely about defense. They’ve allowed 14.0 fewer points per 100 possessions in their wins (103.8) than they have in their losses (117.8).


Before the New York game (two nights after his team gave up 25 second-chance points to the Warriors), coach Chris Finch boiled it down to rebounding. But there have also been big win-loss differentials regarding opponent shooting, opponent free throw rate and opponent turnover rate. The Wolves’ effective field goal percentage difference has been almost as big in the paint (52.7% in wins vs. 58.1% in losses) as it’s been from the outside (46.9% vs. 54.3%).


With Donte DiVincenzo out with a sprained toe, Mike Conley is back in the starting lineup. But the Wolves closed the New York win with Nickeil Alexander-Walker on the floor instead of Conley. They’ve been at their best with Alexander-Walker on the floor and have outscored their opponents by 16 points per 100 possessions in his 100 minutes with the other four starters. The sixth-year guard is posting career-best marks in both 2-point percentage (52.2%) and 3-point percentage (41.1%).

The Wolves are two games into a stretch of five straight against teams that rank in the top eight offensively. So their defense will continue to be in the spotlight as they head back out on the road for games against the Grizzlies and Mavs. They allowed Memphis to score 127 points on 102 possessions (125 per 100) in a two-point loss (at home) nine days ago.

The Bucks have won seven of their last eight games, climbing into the top four in the East, where they trail the third-place Knicks by just a game in the loss column.
Three takeaways

The Bucks rank fourth offensively over the 7-1 stretch, up from 15th prior. Damian Lillard has shot better than 50% (30-for-58) from 3-point range over the eight games, while Giannis Antetokounmpo shot 67% over their four games last week.


The 7-1 stretch also coincides with Taurean Prince moving back into the starting lineup for Khris Middleton. The lineup is still in the red (minus-2.5 points per 100 possessions) for the season, but it had some good minutes last week and Prince has shot much better as a starter (effective field goal percentage of 65.2%) than he did in seven games as a reserve (43.0%).


Middleton is also warming up. He’s averaged 13.4 points (20.6 per 36 minutes) off the bench over his last five games, shooting 17-for-22 (77%) on non-restricted-area 2-pointers. That’s a reminder that he shot a pretty incredible 58.5% from mid-range last season.

For the third straight season, the Bucks are the last team to play in the Mountain or Pacific time zones. Their first excursion out West begins Saturday when a visit to the Intuit Dome is the start of a four-game trip and Game 3 of their second (and final) stretch of five games in seven days.

The Mavs are 10-10 without Luka Dončić (who’s missed the last 12 games), losing another game to the Nuggets last week, but beating the Thunder (without Shai Gilgeous-Alexander) on Friday.
Three takeaways

The win over Oklahoma City was more about defense and the Mavs have ranked 25th offensively (109.1 points scored per 100 possessions) over Dončić’s current, 12-game absence, down from fifth (117.1 per 100) before that. Their loss to Denver on Tuesday was the fourth time in the 12 games that they’ve scored less than a point per possession. Two of those came with Kyrie Irving in the lineup, though the Mavs are still 8-4 in games where they’ve had Irving without Dončić.


They committed only 12 turnovers in the loss to Denver, but overall, the Mavs have committed 2.4 more per 100 possessions with Dončić off the floor (15.1 per 100) than they have with him on the floor (12.7 per 100). Irving’s turnover ratio of 8.4 per 100 possessions used is his highest in the last six seasons.


Dereck Lively II suffered a bad ankle sprain early in the Mavs’ loss to the Nuggets on Tuesday, so they’re relying on Daniel Gafford and Maxi Kleber at the five for the time being. They’ve outscored their opponents by 12.7 points per 100 possessions in 561 minutes with Lively on the floor with Dončić and/or Irving, but are just plus-0.8 per 100 in 617 minutes with Gafford on the floor with one or both of the star guards.

The win over the Thunder began a stretch where the Mavs are playing four of five games against teams that rank in the top seven defensively, with another game against the best team in the West on Thursday.

The Kings’ seven-game winning streak ended Tuesday in Milwaukee, but they’ve picked up two wins since and aren’t far from a top-six spot in the West.
Three takeaways

The Kings still aren’t the offensive team they were two seasons ago, but they’re sixth in offense during this 9-1 stretch, with their top four scorers all averaging more than 20 points per game. With their wild, rest-advantage win over the Rockets on Thursday, they’ve now handed Houston’s fourth-ranked defense its two worst performances of the season.


In their 11 games under interim coach Doug Christie, the Kings have averaged 6.5 more shooting opportunities than their opponents, up from a differential of 1.4 per game in their 31 games under former coach Mike Brown. They’ve cut down on turnovers, but have also seen significant jumps in both offensive and defensive rebounding percentage.


Part of that comes from Trey Lyles and Domantas Sabonis playing almost as many minutes together in 11 games under Christie (130) as they played in 18 games (when both were available) under Brown (144). In those 273 total minutes, the Kings have grabbed 56% of available rebounds.

After the Kings wrap up their three-game homestand with a visit from the Warriors on Wednesday, they’ll play 10 of their final 12 pre-All-Star games on the road, beginning a six-game trip with a rest-disadvantage game in Denver on Thursday night.

The Lakers don’t seem like a very good team, but they’ve managed to stay in the top six in the stronger conference.
Three takeaways

As has been the case during LeBron James’ and Anthony Davis’ tenure in L.A., the Lakers are strongest inside. In their wins over Miami and Brooklyn (by a total of 10 points) last week, they outscored their opponents by 34 points (106-72) in the paint. They’re one of three teams — the Nuggets and Knicks are the others — that rank in the top 10 in both field goal percentage in the paint (58.5%, ninth) and the percentage of their shots that have come in the paint (50%, eighth).


The Lakers have a lot of guys for whom power forward or center would be their primary position, sometimes a few of them play together, and they had some success last week with LeBron James, Anthony Davis and two other big guys on the floor last week. There was even a non-James version on Sunday, where Dorian Finney-Smith was the nominal shooting guard alongside Rui Hachimura, Davis and Jaxson Hayes.


With their narrow win (without Davis) over the Nets on Friday, the Lakers (8-0) remain one of three undefeated teams — the Cavs and Thunder are the others — against the bottom seven teams in the league, though only one of those eight wins was by double-digits. The Lakers’ point differential (minus 2.6 per game) would be the worst in NBA history for a team with a winning record.

They’ll host another one of those bottom-seven teams in the league on Tuesday, one of two games against the Wizards in the next two weeks. The Lakers are 14-14 against the Celtics (7-7 at home, 7-7 on the road) since the last time they met in the Finals (2010), and their first meeting of the season is in L.A. on Thursday when the Lakers will have a rest advantage.

Jimmy Butler returned from his seven-game suspension and the Heat split weekend games against the Nuggets and Spurs.
Three takeaways

Both games were blowouts, so we didn’t get to see if Butler would be on the floor with the score close down the stretch. He had a normal usage rate in his return against Denver but was more of a distributor in the win over the Spurs. The Heat are 13-11 with Butler in uniform and have been at their best offensively (117.8 points scored per 100 possessions) with him on the floor.


Rookie Kel’el Ware has been in the rotation since just before Christmas, but he topped the 30-minute mark for the first two times last week. He tied his career high with 25 points in the win over the Spurs on Sunday when he also played extended minutes alongside Bam Adebayo for the first time. The Heat outscored the Spurs by 23 points, holding them to just 13 points on 27 possessions, in 13.3 minutes with the two bigs on the floor together.


Those 27 possessions have the Heat back in the top 10 defensively, a hair ahead of 11th-ranked Cleveland. If they stay there, this would be the 22nd top-10 defense they’ve had in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data.

Their win over the Spurs on Sunday began a stretch where the Heat are playing seven of 10 games against teams currently below .500, though the schedule will get road-heavy after they host Portland on Tuesday. They’re 11-2 (tied for fourth best) against the 10 teams that currently have losing records.

The Warriors suffered a brutal loss in Toronto last Monday, blowing a nine-point, fourth-quarter lead. But they finished their four-game trip with a big win in Minnesota and took care of business against the Wizards over the weekend.
Three takeaways

Draymond Green returned from a three-game absence on Saturday, only to suffer a calf injury early in the first quarter of the Warriors’ win over Washington. The Warriors have, statistically, been just as good (better offensively, worse defensively) in 345 minutes with Stephen Curry on the floor without Green (plus-5.5 points per 100 possessions) as they’ve been in 703 minutes with the two on the floor together (plus-5.5).


The three opponents last week combined to shoot 51-for-111 (46%) from 3-point range, but the Warriors’ top-10 defense continues to be strongest inside. In the two wins, they held the Wolves and Wizards to just 32-for-79 (41%) in the paint.


Overall, the Warriors are the only team that ranks in the top five in both opponent field goal percentage in the paint (54.4%, third) and the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come in the paint (46%, fifth lowest). Opponents have shot just 41.4% on shots that Kevon Looney has defended, with the expected field goal percentage on those shots being 48.2%. That’s the fourth-biggest differential among 199 players who’ve defended at least 300 total shots.

Their win over the Wizards on Saturday began a stretch where the Warriors are playing eight of nine games at home, with the only road game being a short trip to Sacramento on Wednesday. Green is out for their game against the Celtics on Monday afternoon.

The Hawks are back on the upswing, with a three-game winning streak highlighted by an overtime victory in Boston on Saturday.
Three takeaways

With the win in Boston, the Hawks have the best record (8-2) in games played between the eight Eastern Conference teams that are currently over .500. They’ve allowed just 108.5 points per 100 possessions over those 10 games. Overall, this would be just the second time in the last eight seasons that the Hawks haven’t ranked in the bottom 10 defensively. They’ve seen the league’s fourth-biggest drop in points allowed per 100 possessions from last season.


The Hawks still have a negative point differential (that of an 18-23 team). They won comfortably in Chicago on Wednesday, but have also won six of their last seven games that were within five points in the last five minutes. They’ve scored an incredible 78 points on just 53 clutch possessions (1.47 per) over that stretch, with Trae Young shooting 6-for-10 on clutch 3s and 11-for-12 on clutch free throws.


Onyeka Okongwu made the biggest plays in overtime on Saturday, blocking Jaylen Brown, grabbing a huge offensive rebound and draining a pair of free throws with 11 seconds left. The Hawks’ bench ranks just 19th this season, though that’s a slight improvement from last season (21st), De’Andre Hunter remains a Sixth Man of the Year candidate, and they’ve outscored their opponents by 15.6 points per 100 possessions in Okongwu’s 87 total minutes over the three-game winning streak.

That 8-2 record within the East’s top eight includes a 2-0 mark against the Knicks, with the Hawks’ Dec. 11 win in New York being one of the Knicks’ worst offensive games of the season. They’re back at Madison Square Garden on Monday afternoon.

The last six games have been the Suns’ best stretch of offense this season (121.9 points scored per 100 possessions), with the context that none of the five opponents (they played the Hawks twice) rank higher than 17th defensively. Devin Booker has seemingly found a rhythm, averaging 31.8 points on a true shooting percentage of 63.8% over the six games.


The Suns got destroyed on the glass (they were outscored 27-9 on second chances) in their loss in Atlanta on Tuesday. Jusuf Nurkić lost his starting job, but before the weekend, Phoenix had been much better on the defensive glass (defensive rebounding percentage of 76.3%) with him on the floor than it had been with him off the floor (68.5%).


The Suns traded for Nick Richards on Wednesday, and he had as good of a debut as they could ask for. He had 21 points (on 7-for-8 shooting) and 11 rebounds, with the Suns outscoring Detroit by 22 points in his 29 1/2 minutes off the bench on Saturday afternoon. The fifth-year big has seen a jump in defensive rebounding percentage every season he’s been in the league.

The Suns have two games left on their longest road trip of the season. The Cavs (who they’ll visit on Monday) haven’t been dominant on the glass, but they’ll certainly be a huge test of Phoenix’s recent success.

The Pistons got a big win in New York last Monday, but have dropped back to .500, losing two straight games for the first time since early December.
Three takeaways

Malik Beasley probably wouldn’t mind facing the Knicks in the playoffs, having shot 13-for-18 from 3-point range in the Pistons’ two wins at Madison Square Garden, with two weak-side daggers in the final minute (with Cade Cunningham attacking Jalen Brunson in the pick-and-roll) on Monday. Beasley (9-for-20) and Tim Hardaway Jr. (7-for-11) are two of the 12 players with at least seven clutch 3-pointers this season.


With that victory in New York, the Pistons have as many clutch wins (14-10) as they had total wins all of last season (14-68).


The Pistons shot just 18-for-69 (26%) from 3-point range over the losses to the Pacers and Suns, falling to 10-11 at home. They’ve still seen big jumps in both 3-point percentage and 3-point rate (having ranked in the bottom five in both last season), but have the league’s fourth biggest differential between their record when they’ve shot the league average (36.0%) or better from 3-point range (14-5, with nine straight wins) and their record when they’ve shot worse (7-16).

The Pistons now embark on their longest road trip of the season (five games over 10 days), which begins in Houston on Monday and includes big games against each of the three teams — Atlanta, Orlando and Indiana — within striking distance in the Eastern Conference standings.

The Magic remain shorthanded and their remarkable resilience has seemingly dissipated. They’ve lost five of their last six games, continuing to really struggle offensively.
Three takeaways

The Magic trailed all three of their games last week by at least 24 points, losing all eight quarters they played in Milwaukee and Boston. They still rank in the top three defensively, but the three games were the eighth, ninth and 10th times they’ve allowed more than 115 points per 100 possessions.


The Magic are the only undefeated team when they’ve shot the league average (36.0%) or better from 3-point range, but have only done so eight times, including just twice since Dec. 1. Paolo Banchero has been back for five games, and the Magic have scored less than a point per possession in his 138 minutes over that stretch.


The Magic’s struggles are, in part, due to the strength of their recent schedule. They have a loss to the Jazz this month, but they also have the league’s second-biggest differential between their record against 11 teams currently at or below .500 (14-4) and their record vs. the 19 teams currently above .500 (9-17).

With five of their next six games against teams currently at or below .500, the Magic have an opportunity to right the ship somewhat. They’re tied in the loss column with the ninth-place Pistons (21-21), who they’ll host on Saturday, having split the first two meetings.

The Spurs head to Paris having lost six of their last seven games, sliding from eighth to 12th place in the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

The Spurs got a comeback win in L.A. last Monday, outscoring the Lakers by 34 points (52-18) over the final 15 1/2 minutes. But they’ve also led five of these last six losses (including each of their three last week) by double-digits. Their 29 losses (they’re 33-29) after leading by double-digits over the last two seasons are six more than any other team has.


Before Wednesday, the Spurs were the league’s third-best third-quarter team (plus 11.8 points per 100 possessions). And then they lost each of their last three third quarters by at least 18 points. Over the three-game losing streak, they’ve allowed an amazing 155.6 points per 100 possessions after halftime and, with that, they are now a worse-than-average defensive team.


With Jeremy Sochan out, rookie Stephon Castle has been back in the starting lineup for the last five games. He’s been struggling from 3-point range (10-for-48 since mid-December) and the Grizzlies were giving him the Tony Allen treatment, guarding him with Zach Edey and leaving him alone on the perimeter. But Castle still averaged 23 points over a three-game stretch that included the two losses to Memphis, shooting 20-for-29 (69%) in the paint.

The Spurs head to Paris having won just three of their nine games against the Eastern Conference, and two games against Indiana will test their struggling defense.

Joel Embiid, dealing with both a foot sprain and knee swelling, has now missed the last eight games, stuck at 13 games played for the season. The Sixers took the Knicks to overtime in a rest-disadvantage game on Wednesday, but have lost six straight and are 8-20 without the 2023 League MVP.
Three takeaways

Embiid, of course, isn’t the only guy missing games. Paul George has missed three of the last four, Caleb Martin has missed five straight, Andre Drummond has missed 12 of the last 14, and Guerschon Yabusele missed both of their games over the weekend. The Sixers played eight guys in Milwaukee on Sunday and five of them were second-round picks (1) or undrafted (4), with four of those five in their first or second season.


The Sixers are the only team without a lineup that’s played at least 75 minutes this season, and their most-used lineup (72 minutes) doesn’t include Embiid. They had a great lineup that played more than 200 minutes last season, but that was in just 14 total games.


The good news is that Tyrese Maxey shot 6-for-15 from 3-point range in Milwaukee on Sunday, having shot just 12-for-47 (26%) from beyond the arc over his previous five games. The Sixers need him to play as many minutes as possible, as they’ve been outscored by 26.4 points per 100 possessions in his 101 minutes off the floor over these last eight games without Embiid.

With Embiid set to miss the Sixers’ game in Denver on Tuesday, he and Nikola Jokić will have faced each other in just eight of a possible 21 games since they were both drafted in 2014, including just of three of nine over the last five seasons. The Sixers are 6-2 against the Nuggets when they’ve both played, but just 2-6 when they’ve faced Jokić without Embiid.

The Pelicans are still one loss from matching their 2023-24 total because they’ve won three straight games for the first time.
Three takeaways

The Pelicans have had a top-10 offense (117.7 points scored per 100 possessions) as they’ve won six of their last nine games, and one key has been a big reduction in turnovers. They’ve averaged just 12.1 per 100 possessions (second fewest) over that stretch, down from 15.2 per 100 (18th) prior. They had seven fewer turnovers than the Mavs in their three-point win on Wednesday when they also benefitted from an uncalled goaltending violation (after a turnover) in the closing seconds.


Zion Williamson missed that game and has still played in just four games since returning from a two-month absence. But he shot 10-for-14 in the Pelicans’ win in Chicago on Tuesday and had 14 rebounds, six assists and three blocks as they beat the Jazz over the weekend. His 2.99 steals + blocks per 36 minutes would be a huge jump from his career-high rate of 2.02 per 36 last season.


Their win over the Jazz came with the Pelicans’ largest margin of victory (13) and their most efficient offensive performance of the season (136 points on 104 possessions). This 6-3 stretch has included the only three times they’ve taken at least half of their shots from 3-point range.

Now 4-5 in games played between the bottom seven teams in the league, the Pelicans will host the Jazz again on Monday and face the Hornets and Raptors on a three-game trip that begins over the weekend.

Statistically, the Blazers have been the second-worst team in the league. But they’re seventh in the upside-down standings, completing a five-game homestand with a win over the Bulls on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Scoot Henderson was in the starting lineup (for the first time since before Thanksgiving) on Tuesday and responded with a career-high 39 points against Brooklyn. The scoring didn’t stop there and he averaged a team-high 25.3 points over the Blazers four games last week, shooting 16-for-30 (53%) from 3-point range. That included 8-for-14 on pull-up 3s.


Jerami Grant returned from a nine-game absence over the weekend, but Deandre Ayton missed the Blazers loss to the Rockets on Saturday, while Anfernee Simons wasn’t available the following day. The Blazers have been outscored by 20.7 points per 100 possessions with all three of their veteran starters on the floor, with that being the worst mark among 232 three-man combinations that have played at least 350 minutes together.


The Jazz are setting a record by allowing 29.9 transition points per game, but the Blazers aren’t far behind. They allowed 33.8 per game over their five-game losing streak before holding the Bulls (who rank second in transition points per game) to just 15 on Sunday, according to Synergy tracking.

The Blazers’ third (and final) stretch of five games in seven days concludes with a three-game trip through the Southeast Division. They’re 4-3 in games played between the bottom seven teams in the league and will be at a rest disadvantage for their first meeting with the Hornets on Friday.

Woof. The Bulls have a five-game losing streak, with four of the losses having come to the Pelicans, Hawks (without three starters), Hornets and Blazers.
Three takeaways

The Bulls still rank seventh in defensive rebounding percentage, having seen the league’s fifth-biggest jump from last season. But they’ve allowed more than 20 second-chance points in each of the five games in the losing streak.


Josh Giddey has an effective field goal percentage of just 40.2% over the last three weeks, last among 98 players with at least 100 field goal attempts over that stretch and down from 52.1% before that. Bad shooting clearly affects his willingness to shoot, as he has a usage rate of just 16.1% in January, down from 23.1% in December.


The Bulls continue to play fast. They’ve averaged 7.3 more possessions per 48 minutes than they did in 2023-24. That would be the fourth biggest season-to-season jump for any team in the last 20 years. They were a minus-9 in transition in Portland on Sunday, but have still outscored their opponents by 7.9 points per game in transition, with only the Grizzlies (plus-8.8) having a bigger differential.

With the Bulls’ game against the Clippers being moved up a day (to Monday) to accommodate other changes to the schedule, it’s now the second game of a back-to-back and the end of a (second) stretch of five in seven days. With a loss to the shorthanded Hawks last week, Chicago is 1-6 (with four straight losses) in the second game of back-to-backs.

The Raptors are 1-19 on the road, but won a pair of home games last week, edging the Warriors and stunning the Celtics with two of their best defensive performances of the season.
Three takeaways

The Raptors had huge margins in the paint in both wins and again in their loss in Milwaukee on Friday, outscoring the three opponents by a total of 60 points (166-106) inside. Their average margin in the paint (plus-5.2 points per game) ranks fifth and is up from minus-0.3 per game (16th) last season, with the bigger improvement coming on defense.


The flip side is that the Raptors have the league’s biggest 3-point discrepancy (minus-8.7 points per game) by a huge margin, with a discrepancy almost double that (-16.9) as they’ve been outscored from beyond the arc in each of their last eight games. They’ve outscored their opponents from 3-point range a league-low nine times this season.


Scottie Barnes has been posting up a little more lately. He’s had at least five post-ups in three of his 12 games since Christmas (including six against Golden State last Monday), having had no more than four in his 27 games before that, according to Second Spectrum tracking. He’s shot just 17-for-44 (39%) from the post, with only four assists (with four turnovers) on his 71 total post-ups this season.

One of the four teams with a bigger paint differential than the Raptors is the Hawks (plus-5.5 per game), who Toronto will visit twice this week. The previous meeting was one of the three times this season that Atlanta has held an opponent under a point per possession.

The Jazz are 1-2 on a stretch of four straight games (and 3-3 for the season) within the bottom seven teams in the league, set to play a second straight game in New Orleans on Monday.
Three takeaways

John Collins has missed 12 of the last 13 games, Jordan Clarkson has missed the last seven and Lauri Markkanen has missed the last three. Three of the Jazz’s top five guys in total minutes this month are rookies, and they’ve climbed to third in the percentage of their season-long minutes (35%) that have come from rookies or second-year players.


One of those rookies is Cody Williams, who has started the last three games and shot just 4-for-20. For the season, the Jazz have been outscored by 20.6 points per 100 possessions with Williams on the floor, with that being the worst on-court mark among the 368 players who’ve averaged at least 10 minutes in 10 games or more.


Second-year guard Keyonte George returned from a five-game absence last week and totaled 52 points in Utah’s losses to the Hornets and Pelicans. More important may be that he committed just one turnover in more than 58 minutes over the two games, with Isaiah Collier handling the ball more. Whether or not the Jazz have a starting point guard within their young core is a big question that needs to be answered whenever they decide to be competitive again.

The Jazz’s four-game trip will get much tougher after they play a second game in New Orleans. They committed 29 turnovers in a 27-point loss last month in Oklahoma City, where they’ll play again on Wednesday.

The Nets got a win in Portland last week, but are now 5-19 (somehow two teams have been worse) since Thanksgiving, and they lost by 59 to the Clippers on Wednesday.
Three takeaways

Over their 19 games before Thanksgiving, the Nets had a top-10 offense. They rank last on offense since then, and their 67 points on 96 possessions (69.8 per 100) against the Clippers was the least efficient game for any team (regular season or playoffs) since Nov. 14, 2018 (when the Jazz scored 68 on 101 in a 50-point loss at Dallas).


The Nets have been solid offensively since Christmas with their best players on the floor, but their best players haven’t played much. After Cam Johnson returned from a five-game absence and scored 24 points in the Nets’ win in Portland, he missed the next two games. Cam Thomas, meanwhile, has missed 23 of the last 25 games.


D’Angelo Russell had a four-game absence and also missed the second game of the Nets’ back-to-back last week. He returned to score 19 points off the bench against the Lakers but missed a step-back 3-pointer for the win. The Nets are 4-for-22 on clutch shots in their last four games that have been within five points in the last five minutes.

The Nets have played 26 of their 43 games on the road, and they’ll now play 10 of their next 12 at home, where they’ve scored just 101 points per 100 possessions as they’ve lost seven straight. They’ve also lost eight straight games to the Knicks, who they’ll host on Tuesday.

The Hornets have won three out of four for the first time, finishing their three-game road trip (truncated by two postponements) with wins in Utah and Chicago. But they’ve lost Brandon Miller indefinitely to a wrist injury.
Three takeaways

After scoring just 101.4 points per 100 possessions over the 10-game losing streak that preceded it, the Hornets have scored 116.6 per 100 over this 3-1 stretch. LaMelo Ball has been the leading scorer (averaging 27.5 points) over the four games, though he’s shot just 13-for-51 (25%) from 3-point range, with Miles Bridges and Mark Williams (who’s averaged 24.7 over the last three) scoring much more efficiently.


The Hornets got just six games (and 77 total minutes) with their starting lineup — Ball, Miller, Josh Green, Bridges and Williams — together before Miller tore a ligament in his right wrist. They were a plus-10 in those 77 minutes, having outscored the Suns and Jazz by 31 points (scoring 83 on just 59 offensive possessions) in a little less than 28 minutes over the road trip. Those 77 minutes are still the most that any Charlotte lineup has played.


Miller’s true shooting percentage of 54% (down from 55.2% last season) was a little more efficient since Dec. 1 (55.3%) than he was prior (53.1%). Overall, he’s taken just 32% of his shots in the paint, down from 37% as a rookie and the 37th-lowest rate among 226 players with at least 200 total field goal attempts.

The Hornets’ nine-game home stand — the longest homestand in the league this season — begins with a weekend back-to-back against the Blazers and Pelicans. After their win in Utah last week, the Hornets are still just 2-3 in games played between the bottom seven teams in the league.

The Wizards have their second double-digit losing streak of the season and now have four fewer wins than every other team.
Three takeaways

Statistically, the Wizards haven’t been quite as bad over this 10-game losing streak (minus 17.2 points per 100 possessions) as they were over their 16-game streak earlier in the season (minus 18.9). The offense has been better than those of the Nets and Magic over the last 17 days, with six guys who’ve played in at least seven of the 10 games having averaged double-figures.


Leading scorer Jordan Poole continues to score much more efficiently (true shooting percentage of 59.3%) than he did last season (52.9%). His 73-for-160 (45.6%) on pull-up 3-pointers is the second-best mark among 58 players who’ve attempted at least 75 and is up from 30.4% last season.


Kyle Kuzma continues to struggle, with his true shooting percentage of 48.8% being the lowest mark of his career by a wide margin and ranking 180th among 185 players with at least 250 field goal attempts, with Kyshawn George (184th), Alex Sarr (179th), Bilal Coulibaly (173rd) and Bub Carrington (166th) also in the bottom 20. The good news is that Kuzma was 11-for-12 from the free throw line over the Wizards’ two losses over the weekend, having shot just 10-for-27 (37%) from the stripe over his previous 10 games.

The Wizards’ game in Utah got moved to March, with a game against the Clippers moved up to Thursday. So their six-game trip got more difficult, and they’re now 1-16 (0-7 on the road) against the Western Conference.

The Thunder blew a 14-point lead at Golden State on Wednesday, getting clobbered in the second half. But they returned to do the clobbering against the Kings over the weekend.
Three takeaways

The loss on Wednesday was just the Thunder’s third (they’re 37-3) in a game they led by double-digits, their first (after 25 straight wins) since Nov. 19. They still rank as the best defensive team (8.7 fewer points allowed per 100 possessions than the league average) in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data, but they allowed the Warriors to score 68 points on 49 possessions (1.39 per) after halftime.


With a 36-31 opening period against the Kings on Saturday, the Thunder haven’t lost the first quarter in their last 12 games. For the season, they’re a plus-19.0 per 100 possessions in the first quarter, easily the best mark for any team in any period.


Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the way with 13 points in the first quarter on Saturday, but Aaron Wiggins (starting in place of Jalen Williams) finished with a career-high 41. Wiggins (true shooting percentage of 58.7%) has seen a big drop in efficiency from last season (66.4%), but has been a big part of what would be the best bench (aggregate NetRtg of plus-6.7) in the 29 seasons of play-by-play data.

The last time the Thunder saw the Bucks, they got crushed in the Emirates NBA Cup final in Las Vegas. They scored just 81 points on 97 possessions, their worst offensive performance of the season by a huge margin. The first of two meetings that count toward the regular season standings is in Oklahoma City on Monday when the Thunder will have a rest advantage. They’ll be at a disadvantage in Memphis over the weekend, Game 2 of their second (and final) stretch of five games in seven days.

The Rockets began Week 15 with a big win in Boston, and they ended it with a pair of losses, including one to the Nets.
Three takeaways

The loss to Brooklyn (as well as their loss in Memphis two nights earlier) came without Alperen Sengun (calf contusion). The Rockets had some success (12-6) without Sengun at the end of last season, but have dropped their first two games without him this year. Though the offense wasn’t very good on Saturday, the bigger issues over the two losses were on the other end of the floor, with the Grizzlies and Nets combining for 132 points in the paint.


For the season, 51% of their opponents’ shots have come in the paint, with that being the league’s highest opponent rate. But they rank third in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (54.2%), having seen the league’s fifth-biggest drop from last season.


Before their loss to Brooklyn, the Rockets’ last five games were all within five points in the last five minutes. They now rank fourth in total clutch games, with their win in Atlanta on Tuesday giving them as many clutch wins (they’re 17-10) as they had all of last season (17-23). Only the Pistons and Cavs have seen bigger jumps in clutch winning percentage.

After losing to the Nets in a single home game, the Rockets are back out on the road for a second-straight four-game trip, also the first four games of their second (and final) stretch of five in seven days. Sengun is listed as questionable for their visit to Madison Square Garden on Monday.

The Cavs have followed their three-game losing streak with four straight wins, building their lead over the Celtics back up to six games in the loss column.
Three takeaways

The offense wasn’t the issue over the losing streak, and the Cavs have scored more than 130 points per 100 possessions in each of their last three games, giving them 12 games of more than 130 per 100 for the season. The Nuggets are next with nine and there are three teams — the Bucks, Magic and Wizards — who haven’t scored more than 130 per 100 in a game at all.


The Cavs scored 2.3 more points per 100 possessions than any other team while ranking in the bottom 10 in both free throw rate (23rd) and offensive rebounding percentage (22nd). Shooting remains the most important thing in this league and they’re the most effective shooting team in NBA history (59.0%) by a healthy margin, topping the Pacers’ mark of 57.8% last season. Ten of the 11 Cavs who’ve attempted at least 100 shots have an effective field goal percentage above the league average (54.1%).


The one exception is Sam Merrill, who tied his career high with 27 points (shooting 9-for-13 from 3-point range) as the Cavs clobbered the short-handed Mavs on Sunday. That game also marked the return of Caris LeVert from a seven-game absence, though the Cavs are still without Isaac Okoro and Dean Wade. Bench minutes have remained strong with Ty Jerome and Georges Niang both having big games last week.

The top two teams in the East split their first two meetings, with the Cavs coming back from a 12-point, fourth-quarter deficit in the game in Cleveland. The third meeting of four is back at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse on Tuesday.

The Celtics didn’t necessarily need to turn their season around, but maybe they rediscovered their mojo by turning one game around.
Three takeaways

The Celtics were seemingly cruising through another sub-standard performance on Sunday, falling into a 26-point hole late in the third quarter in Philadelphia. They had lost their previous nine games that they trailed by double-digits in the second half. But they then outscored the Sixers by 34 points (54-20) over the final 14:45, with that being tied for the largest comeback (to win) for any team this season. Coach Joe Mazzulla loves it when his team has to overcome obstacles, so this was probably his favorite game of the season.


The Celtics shot an unsustainable 12-for-16 from 3-point range over that 14:45, but their offensive possessions were more purposeful (like they were in last year’s playoffs) and they also locked down Tyrese Maxey (0-for-5 shooting) as they made the comeback.


Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum played the entire second half on Sunday, while Al Horford didn’t see the floor over the final 24 minutes. Kristaps Porziņģis was also on the bench for much of the comeback, with Luke Kornet at the five. The Celtics’ preferred starting lineup is still struggling and has been outscored by 1.4 points per 100 possessions in its 262 minutes this season.

If the last 15 minutes in Philly on Sunday were a turning point in the season, it was great timing, because the Celtics will visit the first-place Cavs and third-place Knicks this week. They lead New York by two games in the loss column with three meetings remaining.

The Grizzlies’ six-game winning streak came to an end with a 37-point loss in New York last Monday, but they responded with quality wins over the Rockets and Bucks, climbing into second place in the West.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies came back from five points down with less than two minutes left against Houston on Thursday and then pulled away in the final few minutes in Milwaukee. They’ve now won their last four games that were within five points in the last five minutes, having held their opponents to just 11 points on 28 clutch possessions. They still have a losing record (10-11) in clutch games for the season, but now rank third in clutch defense.


The overall defense hasn’t been great of late, with two of the Grizzlies’ three worst performances on that end of the floor coming in the last 10 days. Rebounding has been an issue, with the Knicks, Rockets and Bucks totaling 77 second-chance points over their three games last week. This would be the third straight season that the Grizzlies rank in the bottom 10 in defensive rebounding percentage.


But the offense has been kind of ridiculous, scoring almost 123 points per 100 possessions as the Grizzlies have won nine of their last 11 games. That’s with Ja Morant having missed four of the 11, and with 11 players logging at least 100 total minutes.

The Grizzlies have the West’s toughest February schedule regarding cumulative opponent winning percentage, with only three of their 11 February games against teams currently below .500. Two of those three are this week, and they’ll host the Spurs on Monday, having scored 131.2 points per 100 possessions (the best mark for any team against San Antonio) as they’ve won the first two meetings.

The Knicks are 2-1 on their stretch of four straight home games against top-five teams in the West, beating the Grizzlies and Nuggets comfortably, but losing to the Lakers on Saturday.
Three takeaways

As has been the case most of the season, the Knicks have won with elite offense. They scored more than 124 points per 100 possessions over the five-game winning streak that preceded the weekend loss to L.A., with their wins over the Kings and Grizzlies being the worst defensive games for those teams all season. Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart combined for 77 assists and just 16 turnovers over the five games and the Knicks have seen the league’s biggest jump in assist/turnover ratio from last season (1.84, 23rd) to this season (2.13, fifth).


As has been the case most of the season, the Knicks have lost with sub-par defense. The Lakers scored 128 points on 99 possessions on Saturday (even though they had just three offensive rebounds), and New York has allowed more than 123 per 100 in each of its last four losses.


OG Anunoby suffered a foot sprain in the loss to the Lakers. He’s listed as questionable for Monday, when the Knicks’ stretch of 12 of 14 at home comes to an end with a visit from the Rockets, so it doesn’t seem like a long-term injury. But it’s another sign that, with the trade deadline three days away, this team could probably use (at least) one more player that coach Tom Thibodeau can trust.

Though they’ll head to Canada after the game against the Rockets, the Knicks will be back at Madison Square Garden for a marquee matchup with the Celtics over the weekend. They haven’t seen the champs since opening night when Boston was 29-for-48 from 3-point range with a little less than nine minutes left (before missing their final 13 attempts from deep).

After losing the first three games, the Nuggets salvaged their five-game trip with wins in Philadelphia and Charlotte.
Three takeaways

The first four games of the trip were the Nuggets’ worst stretch of defense this season (127.9 points allowed per 100 possessions). They briefly fell into the bottom 10 on that end of the floor before finishing the trip against the Hornets without LaMelo Ball.


The Nuggets shot just 7-for-37 (19%) from 3-point range in Charlotte on Saturday but were a plus-14 in the restricted area and a plus-5 at the line. Teams were previously 1-36 when shooting less than 20% from deep, with the only other win (the Lakers vs. Minnesota) having come on opening night. Denver leads the league by a wide margin in point differential in the restricted area (plus-7.5 per game) and ranks second in free throw differential (plus-3.0 per game). The Nuggets are one of three teams – the Thunder and Rockets are the others – with a winning record (18-15) when getting outscored from beyond the arc.


They lost Russell Westbrook to a hamstring issue in the Philly game, the Nuggets played only eight guys (with no DeAndre Jordan) in each of the weekend wins, and bench minutes were not good either night. They’re back home now, but those last two games of the trip were the first two games of their second stretch of five games in seven days.

The good news is that the rest of that five-in-seven stretch will come against the struggling Pelicans (x 2) and Magic. The Nuggets will be home for seven of their next eight games, a stretch that takes them past the All-Star break.

The Pacers’ offense didn’t suffer any jet lag upon its return from Paris, and they continue to have the league’s best record (11-2) in 2025.
Three takeaways

The Pacers have ranked in the top five on both ends of the floor since Jan. 1. But it was their offense that took over as they beat the Pistons and Hawks last week. Though they had two different starting lineups, they got off to great starts both nights, scoring 80 total points on 53 first-quarter possessions (1.51 per), with the three players who started both games — Tyrese Haliburton, Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner — combining to shoot 10-for-14 on first-quarter 3-pointers.


Siakam, named an All-Star reserve last week, is now averaging 20.5 points on a true shooting percentage of 61.6%, his highest mark in the last six seasons (since the year he won a title with Toronto). His 3-point percentage (41.5%) is the highest mark of his career by a wide margin, and so is his field goal percentage in the paint (64.8%), making his paint shots a little more valuable than his 3-pointers. The percentage of his shots that have come in the paint is the lowest of his career, but still more than half (52%).


After Andrew Nembhard and Bennedict Mathurin missed the Pacers’ win over Detroit, they were both back against Atlanta on Saturday, though Aaron Nesmith was on the floor (and hit a huge 3) down the stretch after they blew an 18-point lead. The regular starting lineup has allowed just 100.6 points per 100 possessions, the best mark among the 19 lineups that have played at least 200 minutes.

Among teams that are not in the bottom 10 in the league, the Pacers have the worst record (10-7) against the bottom 10 (teams at least five games below .500). They’ll begin a four-game trip with a back-to-back (their first of 2025) in Utah and Portland.

The Clippers went 2-2 on a four-game trip and are holding on to sixth place in the West.
Three takeaways

Kawhi Leonard still hasn’t logged 30 minutes in a game yet, but he’s played in six straight and played his first fourth-quarter minutes of the season last week. He was even on the floor for a little bit of clutch time as the Clippers won close games in San Antonio and Charlotte, holding the Spurs and Hornets scoreless on four total clutch possessions.


The Clippers have climbed out of the bottom 10 on offense, scoring 0.04 more points per 100 possessions than the 21st-ranked Sixers. Their win over the Spurs was the sixth time they’ve scored more than 125 points per 100 possessions, with offensive rebounding being a big part of three of those efficient performances. They were a plus-15 on second chances in the San Antonio game, the second time in January that Ivica Zubac had at least 20 points and 20 rebounds.


With Leonard playing more, the Clippers’ starting lineup has eclipsed the 100-minute plateau, and it’s outscored opponents by 38.5 points per 100 possessions, the best mark among the 62 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes. But the Clips were without Norman Powell (hip soreness) in Toronto on Sunday, when they allowed the Raptors to score 19 points on their first 12 possessions and shoot 13-for-25 from 3-point range.

The Clippers will close their pre-break schedule with a four-game homestand that includes a huge game against the Lakers on Tuesday and rest-advantage games against the Jazz and Grizzlies.

The Wolves had their first five-game winning streak of the season but were without Anthony Edwards (illness) and Julius Randle (groin injury) on Saturday and lost to a team (Washington) that had dropped 16 straight.
Three takeaways

The winning streak was the Wolves’ best five-game stretch of offense this season, with their 138 points on 94 possessions in Utah on Thursday being the second most efficient game for any team this season. Edwards averaged 31.5 points (on 53% shooting) and 7.3 assists over the five games, which included a critical victory in Phoenix on Wednesday.


The loss to Washington was the first game that Edwards missed this season and (statistically) the Wizards’ second-best defensive game of the season (103 points on 100 possessions). Overall, the Wolves have scored 8.7 more points per 100 possessions with Edwards on the floor (114.3) than they have with him off the floor (105.6), with that being his biggest on-off differential on offense in his five years in the league.


Over those five years (and including Play-In and playoff games), Edwards has played in 380 (96%) of a possible 397 games. The only players who’ve played more total minutes than him this season are three of the Knicks’ starters.

The Wolves’ loss to the Wizards on Saturday was the start of a five-game homestand that ends with their fourth meeting against the Blazers, to whom they lost twice in November. They’ll have a rest advantage against the Bulls on Wednesday, currently 7-2 in rest-advantage games.

The Lakers remain blessed. For some reason, they were the only team the Mavs contacted about trading Luka Dončić, who gives them another elite franchise cornerstone for the next several years.
Three takeaways

Dončić and LeBron James are seemingly in the same mold, but with the latter now 40 years old, Dončić gives the Lakers a lot more (consistent) juice off the dribble. They currently rank 27th with 37.9 drives per game, but Dončić ranked third among individuals with 17.8 per game last season.


Those drives create open and in-rhythm 3-pointers, which should help a team that has ranked 18th in 3-point percentage (36.0%) over the last three seasons. Only Tyrese Haliburton has assisted on more 3s per game over that timeframe than Dončić (3.7), with the Mavs shooting 38.9% from deep off his passes (according to Second Spectrum tracking) and 36.5% otherwise since the start of the 2022-23 season.


The Lakers need a center in the short term, though even with Davis, they haven’t had a great paint defense this season. They rank 17th in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (56.9%) and 27th in the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come in the paint (50%), and those numbers weren’t much different (57%, 49%) when Davis was on the floor.

It’s unclear when Dončić will play for the Lakers, who will play a huge game at the Intuit Dome on Tuesday. They lost there 15 days ago, getting clobbered on the glass and trailing by as many as 26 points.

The Bucks slid out of the top four in the East after losing three straight games for the first time since early November.
Three takeaways

They’ve allowed an amazing 131.9 points per 100 possessions over the losing streak, with the three losses marking three of the Bucks’ four worst defensive games of 2024-25. Rebounding was a consistent issue, but the Spurs also made 24 3-pointers while committing just six turnovers as they scored 144 points on 104 possessions on Friday.


With rebounding issues and an inability to force turnovers, the Bucks have had 52 fewer shooting opportunities than their opponents over their last five games. They now rank 26th in shooting-opportunity differential, with a discrepancy of 3.2 per game.


Giannis Antetokounmpo had 30 or more points in the paint in both games of the Bucks’ Utah-Portland back-to-back last week, giving him six for the season. That’s tied for the third most games with 30-plus points in the paint for any player in the 29 seasons for which we have shot-location data, trailing only Shaquille O’Neal’s 11 in 1999-00 and Antetokounmpo’s nine last season.

Their loss to the Grizzlies on Sunday was the Bucks’ lone home game in a stretch where they’re playing seven of eight on the road, and they’ll be at a rest disadvantage in Oklahoma City on Monday. With their loss in Portland last week, they’re 0-3 when playing the second game of a back-to-back on the road.

The Mavs have some young talent (including newly acquired Max Christie) in their rotation. But in the next seven weeks, Klay Thompson will turn 35, Anthony Davis will be 32 and Kyrie Irving will turn 33. The time to win is now.
Three takeaways

The Mavs can be terrific defensively with Davis playing alongside either of the Mavs’ two young centers. Daniel Gafford (46%) and Dereck Lively II (54.4%) rank first and ninth, respectively, in rim protection among 58 players who’ve defended at least 150 shots at the basket. If the Mavs keep them both beyond the deadline, Davis will eventually (when Lively is healthy) get his wish and likely be a full-time power forward.


But there will be spacing issues on offense, with Gafford and Lively a combined 0-for-3 in their careers from 3-point range and Davis shooting just 26% on 3-pointers over the last five seasons. The Lakers’ comp for the Mavs’ two centers is Jaxson Hayes and L.A. scored just 104.2 points per 100 possessions in 159 total minutes with Davis and Hayes on the floor together over the last two years.


The Mavs might also seek some off-the-dribble creation between now and Thursday’s trade deadline. They’ve ranked sixth in drives per game (P.J. Washington has been attacking more) since the last time Luka Dončić played, but have scored just 105.6 points per 100 possessions with Irving off the floor over that stretch.

Davis suffered an abdominal strain on Tuesday, so it’s possible that he won’t make his Mavs debut until after the All-Star break. Dallas’ toughest games between now and then are meetings with the Celtics and Rockets this week.

The Suns have improved over the last month and got a good win over the Clippers last Monday. But they haven’t been able to push themselves into the top six in the West, losing a big game against the Wolves on Wednesday, and then coming up empty in Portland over the weekend.
Three takeaways

The Suns shot 22-for-47 (47%) from 3-point range on Monday, outscoring the Clippers by 36 points from beyond the arc. It was the seventh time (first since Dec. 13) that they took more than half of their shots from 3-point range, but it wasn’t the start of a trend. The Suns rank 11th in 3-point rate (43.3%) for the season, but are 22nd (40.0%) over the last seven weeks, down from sixth (46.4%) prior.


Over their last five games, the Suns have been outscored by 67 points (114-47) on fast breaks. According to Synergy tracking, they rank 28th in the percentage of their possessions (16.3%) that have been in transition, though that rate is a small jump from last season (15.9%, 26th). Tyus Jones ranks third in the league with 8.0 hit-ahead passes per game, according to Second Spectrum.


With their loss in Portland on Saturday, the Suns are just 2-7 (.222) in the second game of back-to-backs and 23-16 (.590) with rest. That’s the league’s biggest such differential, and they have two more back-to-backs before the All-Star break.

The Suns will get another shot at the Blazers on Monday and finish their four-game trip in Oklahoma City two nights later. They were without Beal and Durant when they had their worst offensive game of the season (83 points on 96 possessions) there in November.

The Heat have suspended Jimmy Butler for a third time and there are three days left until the trade deadline, with Miami in a tight race for the final guaranteed playoff spot in the East.
Three takeaways

Before last Monday, Bam Adebayo had gone 11 games without scoring 20 points. But he had 26, 21 and 30 as the Heat went 2-1 last week, capping that run with the game-winning buzzer-beater in San Antonio on Saturday night. The 3-point-shooting experiment hasn’t worked particularly well for the eighth-year big, but Adebayo has shot a career-best 44.3% from mid-range (up from 34.4% last season), including 9-for-16 over those three games last week.


When you take the drop in league-average efficiency into account, the Heat are a slightly better offensive team (1.1 points per 100 possessions below average) than they were in 2023-24 (1.3 per 100 below). But they’re still a below-average offensive team for what would be the eighth time in the last 10 seasons. They need to be very good defensively to win: they’re 18-1 when they’ve allowed 107 points per 100 possessions or fewer and 6-22 (with eight straight losses) when they haven’t.


The Heat’s three wins over the last nine days have come against Brooklyn, Orlando and San Antonio (without Victor Wembanyama). All three games were decided by single digits. With their 20-point loss to Cleveland on Wednesday, they’re 0-6 since Jan. 1 against teams that are currently over .500.

Their win in San Antonio began a stretch where the Heat are playing nine of 10 on the road, but they won’t be playing any of those over-.500 teams this week. The next stop on their current, four-game trip is their first of three meetings with the Bulls.

The Warriors have been within one game of .500 after each of their last 14 games and still haven’t won more than two straight since mid-November.
Three takeaways

The Warriors got a quality, rest-disadvantage win last week, holding the Thunder to just 109 points on 101 possessions. Oklahoma City is in the top five in both transition points scored and allowed, but transition points were 28-10 in favor of Golden State on Wednesday, according to Synergy tracking. The Warriors have seen the league’s biggest drop in transition points allowed from last season.


Despite the advantage in transition points, the Warriors were still outscored in the paint on Wednesday, and have been outscored in the paint in nine of the 11 games over Draymond Green’s absence.


The last two opponents have done their best to take Stephen Curry out of the Warriors’ offense. The win over the Thunder and a loss to the Suns on Friday were the 12th and 13th time this season that Curry has registered a usage rate below 25%, with Golden State now 5-8 in those games. The 13 are already three more (relatively) low-usage games that Curry had last season, and his overall usage rate (27.0%) is his lowest in the last 12 years.

The Warriors are trying to get something done at the deadline because it was reported over the weekend that Jimmy Butler isn’t interested in them long-term. Their six-game homestand wraps up with a visit from the Magic on Monday, and they’ll then play 12 of their next 14 games on the road.

So much for the Kings’ post-coaching-change resurgence. Sacramento has lost four of its last five games (its worst five-game stretch of defense this season) and traded De’Aaron Fox on Sunday.
Three takeaways

Fox’s numbers weren’t much different than they were the last two seasons, but the Kings just weren’t been as good with him running the offense. They were outscored by 6.5 points per 100 possessions (scoring just 108.9 per 100) in his 537 minutes on the floor without Domantas Sabonis.


Fox’s time of possession (as a percentage of his total time on the floor) had dropped pretty significantly over the last two years, from 20% in 2022-23 to 15% this season. But he still led the team in possession and the Kings’ rotation is now without a real point guard. So we can expect Sabonis (third in elbow touches per game) to be even more of a hub than he has been.


Zach LaVine arrives having the best season of his career and bringing a big upgrade from beyond the arc, with the Kings being one of four teams that rank in the bottom 10 in both 3-point percentage (34.5%, 24th) and 3-point rate (39.6%, 22nd). Among 43 players who’ve averaged at least 20 points per game, Sabonis (20.8, 67.6%) and LaVine (24.0, 63.7%), rank first and sixth in true shooting percentage.

The Kings were 0-6 against the Pelicans last season but escaped New Orleans with a two-point win in December. The last three ’24-25 meetings are all set to be played in the next 11 days, with the first (Saturday) being one of just two home games in this stretch where the Kings are playing 10 of their final 12 pre-break games on the road.

The Pistons lost the last three games of a five-game trip but returned home to beat two teams — Dallas and Chicago — that made big trades over the weekend.
Three takeaways

With losses in Cleveland and Indiana last week, the Pistons are 3-11 against the top five teams in the East, allowing 119 points per 100 possessions over those 14 games. On Wednesday, the Pacers shot 19-for-38 from 3-point range and had 31 free throw attempts as Detroit allowed more than 130 points per 100 for the second time this season.


The Pistons themselves have made no more than 12 3s in their last nine games. Their starting lineup, with Ausar Thompson in Jaden Ivey’s spot, has taken just 28% of its shots from 3-point range, the second-lowest rate among 56 lineups that have averaged at least 10 minutes in five games or more.


The two wins were relatively efficient offensively (120.2 points scored per 100 possessions). The win over Dallas came with the Pistons’ lowest turnover rate of the season (seven on 97 possessions) and they scored 80 points in the paint (16 more than they’ve had in any other game) against Chicago.

Their win over the Bulls on Sunday began a stretch where the Pistons are playing eight of nine games against teams currently below .500. The lone exception is a visit from the Cavs on Wednesday, when the Pistons will have a rest advantage. They’ve scored just 98.5 points per 100 possessions as they’ve lost the first two meetings with Cleveland.

It appears that the Blazers are a good team now. They’ve won seven of their last eight games, with only one of the wins having been within five points in the last five minutes.
Three takeaways

The Blazers rank second defensively (104.9 points allowed per 100 possessions) over the 7-1 stretch. Three of the games have come against teams — Charlotte and Orlando (x 2) — that rank in the bottom three offensively, but they also held the Suns (who came in with the 11th-ranked offense) to just 108 points on 103 possessions on Saturday.


Their opponents have shot just 29.1% from 3-point range over the eight games, and the Blazers have also held them to just 51.8% shooting in the paint, the third-lowest opponent mark over that stretch.


The Blazers also rank 10th offensively over these last 15 days, with the last four games (124.4 points scored per 100 possessions) having been their most efficient stretch of the season by a healthy margin. Seven guys have averaged double-figures over the four games, led by Deandre Ayton, who scored 24 points on 11-for-12 shooting against his old team on Saturday.

The Blazers have three games left on the first of two seven-game homestands. Another win over the Suns on Monday would make them the third team to match its win total from last season (21-61) and also give them a .500 record at the Moda Center.

The Spurs haven’t been very good over the last month, but they’ve now got themselves a long-term running mate for Victor Wembanyama, having acquired De’Aaron Fox for four* first-round picks.
* Only three, really. One of the four is the Hornets’ first-rounder this year, which will become two second-rounders if it lands in the Lottery (which it will).
Three takeaways

The Spurs have scored 11.2 more points per 100 possessions with Chris Paul on the floor (115.2) than they have with him off the floor (104.0). Paul and Fox will probably play some together, but Fox will surely be running the offense when Paul isn’t and should lift that off-the-floor number quite a bit.


The 27-year-old Fox isn’t the passer that Paul is, but his quickness will bend the defense a lot more. He ranks sixth in the league with 16.0 drives per game, and he’s shot 58.7% in the paint, his second-best mark in his eight seasons in the league.


The Spurs are only two games in the loss column behind the eighth-place, 25-23 Suns, but have played a West-low 46 games, so they’ve got more to make up in the wins column. The Warriors are the only team of the five in front of them who have an easier remaining schedule regarding cumulative opponent winning percentage.

It’s rodeo time in San Antonio and the Spurs, who are one win from matching their total from last season (22-60), will go into the All-Star break with a six-game road trip. They’ve allowed 131.2 points per 100 possessions as they’ve lost their first two meetings with the Grizzlies, who they’ll visit (with a rest advantage) on Monday.

The Sixers are still without Paul George and Joel Embiid, and they suffered a brutal collapse on Sunday, blowing a 26-point lead with less than 15 to go against the Celtics. But they’re still in a much better place than they were a few weeks ago.
Three takeaways

After winning four straight games, the Sixers have lost two in a row. But they were close games against good teams (Denver and Boston) and they rank sixth offensively (121.6 points scored per 100 possessions) over the six-game stretch. Eric Gordon has been on fire from 3-point range, Kelly Oubre Jr. has been crashing the glass, and Guerschon Yabusele had two huge games (49 total points) over the weekend.


Tyrese Maxey has led the way, of course. He had seven straight games of 28 points or more on 50% shooting or better before the Celtics locked him down (taking him from 9-for-16 to 9-for-21) in the final 15 minutes on Saturday. He still scored efficiently against the champs by going 11-for-11 from the line, and he’s now 77-for-80 (96%) from the stripe over the last 25 days.


The Sixers rank second in free throw rate with Embiid (10 attempts per game over his career) having played in only 13 of their 48 games.

After winning eight of their first 39 games, the Raptors have won eight of their last 10.
Three takeaways

The Raptors only rank 21st offensively over this 8-2 stretch, but only the Clippers (who the Raptors just beat on Sunday) have allowed fewer points per 100 possessions over the last three weeks. The last seven games have all come against teams in the bottom half of the league offensively, but it’s still a huge defensive improvement for a team that ranked 28th on defense through Week 12.


The win over the Clippers on Sunday was the Raptors’ first victory (in six games) with their desired starting lineup, which has still played just 85 total minutes together. Immanuel Quickley returned from an eight-game absence over the weekend and shot 8-for-13, but played less than 33 total minutes over two games.


The door to the SoFi Play-In Club is wide open for both the Sixers and Raptors should they want to compete for a playoff spot. Toronto has been playing the best among the teams currently seeded 8-12, and it also has the league’s easiest remaining schedule regarding cumulative opponent winning percentage.

But it doesn’t get easy until the end of the month, and five of the Raptors’ six games before the All-Stare break are against five of the top six teams in the league.

After picking up a big win over the Pistons nine days ago, the Magic lost the first three games of a six-game road trip, sliding below .500 and into eighth place in the East.
Three takeaways

The offense remains ugly. The Magic had a 14-point, fourth-quarter lead in Miami last Monday, but they scored just 26 points on their final 38 possessions as they lost in double-overtime. Then they scored less than a point per possession against two bottom-five defenses in Portland and Utah. Since Christmas, the Magic (101.8) have scored 2.4 fewer points per 100 possessions than the league’s second-worst offense (that of the Wizards) over that stretch.


The offensive numbers have been even worse (93.6 points scored per 100 possessions) in 128 minutes with Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner on the floor together over the five games since the latter’s return. Banchero has shot just 33% (including 5-for-28 from 3-point range) over that stretch.


The Magic still have the fifth-best record (20-15) in games played within the Eastern Conference, but with their losses in Portland and Utah, they’re just 4-11 (third worst among East teams), with seven straight losses against the West.

Two weeks ago, the Hawks were 22-19 and in sixth place in the East. They’ve since lost eight straight games, falling to ninth and Jalen Johnson is out for the season.
Three takeaways

The first six games of the losing streak were more about the offense that now ranks 24th, a huge disappointment given how good the Hawks have been on that end of the floor over the last four years. Even with some improvement over the last two games, the Hawks have shot just 30.2% from 3-point range over the streak, with De’Andre Hunter (who had a great look at a go-ahead 3 go in and out vs. Houston on Tuesday) just 12-for-49 (24%).


The Hawks have been one of the league’s most improved defensive teams this season, but have allowed more than 129 points per 100 possessions over the last two games. That includes 79 on 53 (1.49 per) over the two first quarters, falling into big holes both nights. Neither the Cavs nor the Pacers shot great from 3-point range, but they were a combined 65-for-87 (75%) in the paint.


The losing streak coincides with Onyeka Okongwu starting, though the Hawks have been much better with him on the floor (minus-3.0 points per 100 possessions) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-18.6) over the eight games.

It’s a bad time for the Hawks to be playing poorly because they have a lot of important games in the 6-11 tier in the East this month. They’re 0-2 against the seventh-place Pistons, who they’ll visit (with a rest advantage) on Monday.

The Bulls got a couple of pretty good wins last week, but seemingly pulled the plug on competing for a Play-In spot in the East by trading Zach LaVine (and getting their own 2025 first-round pick back) on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Bulls have beat Toronto (a team that could take that final SoFi Play-In spot from them) twice without LaVine, ending the Raptors’ five-game winning streak (with good minutes from their bench) on Friday. But overall, they were outscored by 8.7 points per 100 possessions (scoring just 105.1 per 100) in 973 minutes with LaVine off the floor.


The Bulls went 174-242 (.418) with LaVine in uniform over his 7 1/2 seasons in Chicago, winning a single playoff game. His was seemingly their hardest contract to trade (though he made it easier by having a career year), so more deals could be coming.


There have been four instances of a team scoring at least 80 points in the paint this season, and the Bulls have been the opponent in three of the four, with Detroit shooting 40-for-61 in the paint on Sunday. There’s a pace factor there (more possessions lead to more points), but the Bulls’ have also allowed the most points in the paint per 100 possessions (53.9).

The Bulls are home for four of their final five games before the All-Star break, though they’ll be at a rest disadvantage when they visit the Wolves on Wednesday.

It’s been a brutal season for the Pelicans, who took their hardest hit on Friday, when Dejounte Murray was lost to a torn right Achilles.
Three takeaways

Murray didn’t play a single minute alongside both Brandon Ingram (who’s now missed the last 25 games) and Zion Williamson (who’s played in only 13). The Pelicans didn’t have all of their top six guys — Murray, CJ McCollum, Herb Jones, Ingram, Trey Murphy III and Williamson — once this season. They’ve had five of the six only twice and on average, they’ve had 3.1 of them per game.


An Achilles tear doesn’t offer the Pelicans the opportunity to just start fresh next fall, as it’s likely Murray (who has a player option in 2027-28) won’t be back until 2026. The good news is that they have their own Draft pick (and likely the Bucks’ pick as well).


Murray’s effective field goal percentage (44.5%) was the worst mark of his career, and his assist/turnover ratio (2.15) was his worst mark in the last six seasons. But he was much better in January than he was prior and had averaged 25 points, 6.8 rebounds and eight assists over his last four (full) games.

The Pelicans take a five-game losing streak into a tough four-game trip, where three of the games are in Denver (x 2) and Oklahoma City. They’re 1-11 against the top seven teams in the West, with the one win having come against the Nuggets without Nikola Jokić.

The Jazz put an end to an eight-game losing streak (their longest of the season) on Saturday, but remain alone in last place in the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

The Jazz have been healthy for the last two games, just the third and fourth times since Christmas that Lauri Markkanen and John Collins have both been available. The Jazz are just 5-9 when they’ve started a frontline of Markkanen, Collins and Walker Kessler, but they’ve now outscored opponents by 5.2 points per 100 possessions in the trio’s 263 minutes on the floor together.


The Utah offense has been at its best (112.6 points scored per 100 possessions) with Collin Sexton on the floor. Sexton led the Jazz in their win over the Magic on Saturday, scoring 22 points and dishing out eight assists. His numbers have been pretty consistent across his three seasons in Utah, over which he has an effective field goal percentage of 55.1%, up from 50.4% over his four seasons in Cleveland.


The last game of the losing streak was not pretty, with the Wolves’ 138 points on 94 possessions on Thursday being the second most efficient game for any team this season. The Utah defense is now responsible for four of the 14 most efficient games of 2024-25.

The Jazz will now face the Pacers’ eighth-ranked offense for the first time, and their visit to Phoenix on Friday will begin a stretch of seven straight games against teams with winning records.

After a seven-game losing streak (with an 0-4 homestand), the Nets went on the road and picked up a couple of wins in Charlotte and Houston.
Three takeaways

The two wins were the Nets’ first two victories (they were previously 0-12) without Cam Johnson, who’s now missed 12 of the last 15 games. The effect of Johnson (and Cam Thomas, who’s missed 29 of the last 31) has been on offense, and it’s been the other end of the floor where the Nets have shown some improvement of late. They’ve allowed 107.1 points per 100 possessions over their last six games (fourth best over that stretch), down from 119.3 over their previous 12.


It’s helped that the opponents have shot just 33.2% from 3-point range over the last six, but the Nets have also seen a reduction in the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come from beyond the arc, while also defending the paint better and fouling less. They’ve allowed just 91.7 points per 100 possessions in 102 minutes with Day’Ron Sharpe on the floor over the six games.


They’ve also been turning teams over a lot. This team still ranks in the bottom five on both ends of the floor, but it ranks eighth in opponent turnover rate (15.4 per 100 possessions), having seen the league’s second biggest jump from last season (12.9 per 100, 24th).

The Nets will go into the All-Star break with a five-game homestand, their longest of the season. It starts with another game against the Rockets, and they’ll have a rest advantage on Tuesday, with Houston at Madison Square Garden the night before.

The Hornets are 1-5 on their nine-game homestand, with a 21-point loss to the Nets included.
Three takeaways

With their four-game losing streak, the Hornets are 1-15 without LaMelo Ball (1-14) or when he’s played fewer than 10 minutes (as he did before turning his ankle against the Lakers last Monday). They’ve scored just 103 points per 100 possessions over those 16 games and just 102 per 100 in their 1,192 total minutes with Ball off the floor. Their 83 points on 90 possessions on Wednesday were, statistically, Brooklyn’s best defensive game of the season.


Miles Bridges is 5-for-32 (16%) from 3-point range over the four-game losing streak and is now below 30% for the season. His 29.5% from deep would be the worst mark for a player averaging at least six 3-point attempts per game since Kobe Bryant shot 28.5% on 7.1 attempts in his final season (2015-16).


Over the four-game losing streak, the Hornets have been 52.5 points per 100 possessions better with Moussa Diabaté on the floor (plus-16.6) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-35.9). For the season, Diabaté is now a plus-71 in 726 minutes for a team that’s 12-34.

The homestand continues with the Hornets’ third meeting with the last-place Wizards. Ball was in the lineup for both of the first two games, but he shot 7-for-31 from 3-point range as Charlotte lost them both.

The Wizards ran their losing streak to 16 games before getting a win in Minnesota (their first road victory since October) on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Wizards still rank last on both ends of the floor and, though the Orlando offense has been much worse than theirs since Christmas, are closer to climbing out of the basement on defense. They’ve scored just 108.9 points per 100 possessions over their three wins since Christmas, with the win on Saturday (when the Wolves were without Anthony Edwards and Julius Randle) being the fifth time they’ve held their opponent under 105 per 100.


With Alex Sarr missing the last 3 1/2 games, Jonas Valančiūnas has been in the starting lineup and Richaun Holmes has been getting minutes off the bench. With the vets manning the middle, the Wizards haven’t been fouling as much, with three of the last four games being the seventh, eighth and ninth times they’ve had an opponent free throw rate below 20 attempts per 100 shots from the field.


The Wizards have played the league’s toughest schedule in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage and, even with the win over the Wolves, are 2-29 against the 16 teams currently over .500.

Now, they finally get a little bit of schedule relief, with 21 of their final 34 games against teams currently at or below .500. Four of their seven wins have come against the Hornets and Hawks and they’ve yet to face the Nets, with games against all three of those teams this week.

The Thunder couldn’t find a solution against the Mavs, losing to Dallas (a possible first-round playoff opponent the way things currently stand) for the third time on Thursday.
Three takeaways

Though Luka Dončić played in only one of the four meetings (the one the Thunder won), only the Cavs have scored more efficiently than the Mavs (114.7 points per 100 possessions) against the Thunder this season. Overall, the Thunder have allowed the sixth-fewest drives per 100 possessions this season. But the Mavs’ 59 points on drives on Thursday were six more than they’ve allowed in any other game.


While the Mavs were without Dončić in all three of their wins against Oklahoma City, maybe it’s more important that the Thunder were without Isaiah Hartenstein in all three. The big man returned from a five-game absence on Sunday and tallied 14 points, 12 rebounds and six assists in his team’s win in Portland. The Thunder have still allowed less than a point per possession in more than 1,000 minutes with either Hartenstein (99.9 per 100) or Chet Holmgren (96.8 per 100) on the floor.


The Thunder continue to be careful with Alex Caruso, who’s averaged just 19.3 minutes over his seven games back from a 10-game absence. The Thunder have outscored their opponents by 27.5 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor over that stretch.

The Thunder now have their third of four two-day breaks in two weeks, and they’ll have a rest advantage at Golden State on Wednesday. The road team won the first two meetings, though the Warriors were without Stephen Curry when the Thunder held them under a point per possession just before Thanksgiving.

The Rockets remain in second place in the West, having swept their two games against the best team in the East.
Three takeaways

The two wins over the Cavs were different, though 3-point shooting (28-for-62, 45%) was critical in both, with Fred VanVleet hitting a pair of triples down the stretch on Wednesday. The Rockets blew double-digit, fourth-quarter leads in both, only to escape with wins with those VanVleet 3-pointers, a big tip-dunk from Amen Thompson on Saturday and Darius Garland missing free throws after an ill-advised foul from Tari Eason. The Rockets are 10-4 in clutch games over the last nine weeks, even though they haven’t shot particularly well from the field with the score within five in the last five minutes.


Thompson recorded his second career triple-double (23, 14 and 10) on Saturday, also acting as the primary defender on Donovan Mitchell. The Rockets’ starting lineup (with Thompson) has been outscored by 10.3 points per 100 possessions in its 144 minutes over the 11 games since Jabari Smith Jr.’s hand injury. However, it was mostly the starters (and a little bit of Eason) on the floor down the stretch of the two games against Cleveland.


The win in Cleveland was a rest-advantage game for the Rockets, with the Cavs having played in Philadelphia the night before. The Rockets themselves have the league’s biggest differential between their record with rest (27-9) and their record in the second games of back-to-backs (3-5).

With their postponed game in Atlanta rescheduled for Tuesday, the Rockets have four back-to-backs between now and the All-Star break. The win in Cleveland was the start of a stretch where they’re playing eight of nine on the road, currently one of eight teams with a better record on the road (15-6) than they have at home (15-7).

The Cavs have lost three straight games for the first time, and they’re just two games into their only stretch of five games in seven days.
Three takeaways

The losing streak hasn’t come with some regression to the mean for the Cavs’ all-time best effective field goal percentage of 58.7%. They shot 42-for-91 (46%) from 3-point range in their weekend back-to-back, tying the franchise record with 25 3-pointers in Philadelphia on Friday. Instead, it’s been their worst three-game stretch of defense by a healthy margin (128.3 points allowed per 100 possessions).


Opponents shot well (49%) from deep and got to the line a ton and grabbed almost 43% of available offensive rebounds. The Cavs rank 25th in defensive rebounding percentage over the last five weeks.


Caris LeVert has now missed the last four games, the Cavs were without Evan Mobley for the first two losses, and the Defensive Player of the Year candidate wasn’t sharp as they lost to the Rockets a second time on Saturday. They’ve still been at their best (plus 12.6 points per 100 possessions) with Mobley on the floor.

The Cavs’ stretch of five games in seven days concludes on Thursday with a visit from the other team (Atlanta) that’s beat them twice. They scored just 107.7 points per 100 possessions as they lost both games of a home-and-home set with the Hawks in late November.

The Celtics suffered their worst loss of the season in L.A. on Thursday but went 3-1 on their trip out West.
Three takeaways

Anthony Davis said after the Lakers’ win on Thursday (just the ninth time that Boston has been outscored from 3-point range) that the game plan was to make the Celtics shoot more off the dribble than off the catch. According to Second Spectrum tracking, 26 of the 30 teams have shot 3-pointers better off the catch than they have off the dribble, with the Celtics having just the 12th biggest differential: 38.3% (eighth best) off the catch vs. 33.4% (14th) off the dribble. That’s a slightly smaller differential than they had last season (when they shot better on both).


A bigger issue for the Celtics was that they shot just 18-for-41 (43.9%) in the paint against the Lakers, their worst mark there since October. They were only slightly better in the paint (19-for-43, 44.2%) in Dallas on Saturday, but were better defensively and committed just five turnovers. After committing 10 or fewer in five of their last seven games, the Celtics have the league’s lowest turnover rate (11.9 per 100 possessions).


The Celtics have seen drop-offs on both ends of the floor (when accounting for the league average), but they’re still the only team that ranks in the top five in offensive and defensive efficiency. If they stay there, they’d be the first team since the league started tracking turnovers in 1977 to rank in the top five on both ends in three straight seasons.

The Celtics are home for just two games before heading out on the road again, set to host the Rockets (who just beat the Cavs twice) on Monday. Their win in Houston early this month was the Rockets’ biggest margin of defeat this season (23 points).

The Grizzlies have won six straight games against a pretty soft stretch of schedule.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies did get a quality win last Monday, coming back from 16 points down to beat the Wolves by two. They have the league’s third-best record (8-11) when trailing by double-digits, but they’re still just 8-11 (tied for seventh worst) in clutch games. They have won three of their last four, holding their opponents – the Wolves (twice) and Spurs — to just 13 points on 23 clutch possessions in the three wins.


They have the league’s top-ranked offense (126.3 points scored per 100 possessions) over the winning streak, with Luke Kennard, Desmond Bane and Jaylen Wells having combined to shoot 55-for-107 (51.4%) from 3-point range over the six games. Kennard’s 48.7% for the season would be the second-best mark for a player with at least 150 attempts in the last 10 seasons, trailing only his own 49.4% two seasons ago.


The Grizzlies’ when-healthy starting lineup eclipsed the 100-minute mark on Saturday and has now outscored opponents by an amazing 41.6 points per 100 possessions, which would be the best mark for any lineup that’s played at least 100 minutes in the 18 seasons for which we have lineup data, topping the mark (plus-40.2 per 100) of the Warriors’ “Death Lineup” in 2015-16.

The Grizzlies are 0-3 against the Rockets, losing the previous two January meetings by six total points. But the tie-breaker won’t matter if they can climb ahead of Houston in the standings, so the fourth and final meeting (Thursday in Memphis) is the biggest game left on their schedule.

The Knicks struggled to put away the Hawks and Nets early last week, but they’ve followed a 3-6 stretch with three straight wins to stay within two games of the second-place Celtics.
Three takeaways

The Knicks’ starting lineup has now played 755 minutes, 257 more than any other lineup in the league. It was outscored in two of their three games last week, but bench minutes (limited as they were) were good. The Knicks’ bench ranks seventh this season, though the 59.9 minutes per game that they’ve gotten from reserves continues to be the fewest for any team in the last 19 years.


The bigger issues during the 3-6 stretch were on defense, but it was nice for the Knicks’ second-ranked offense to bust out (143 points on 104 possessions) against Sacramento on Saturday, with all five starters scoring at least 18 points and Josh Hart recording his sixth triple-double of the season. The Knicks are 6-0 (11-1 over the last two seasons) when Hart has recorded a triple-double.


The Knicks’ win over the Kings came with 12 corner 3s, the second most for any team in a game this season. Mikal Bridges had four of the 12 and now has 70 corner 3s for the season, 21 more than teammate OG Anunoby, who ranks second at 49. If he plays every game (and he always plays every game), Bridges is on pace to crush P.J. Tucker’s record of 109 corner 3-pointers in 2018-19. He’s shot 45.8% from the corners (including 51.2% from the right corner), but just 28.0% on above-the-break 3s.

Their win over the Kings was the start of five straight games (all at Madison Square Garden) against Western Conference teams with winning records. The Knicks have won four of their last five against the Nuggets, with their most efficient offensive performance of the season (145 points on 100 possessions) happening in Denver just before Thanksgiving.

The Nuggets remain in the top four in both the Western Conference and in offensive efficiency. Defense can still be a problem and they suffered their worst defeat of the season in Minnesota on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Wolves’ 133 points on 99 possessions was their second most efficient offensive game of the season and came with 72 points in the paint (a category the Nuggets had been dominating of late). For the season, Denver has seen the league’s fourth-biggest jump in points allowed per 100 possessions (+1.1), with its fourth-biggest jump in opponent field goal percentage in the paint.


The other end of the floor has been OK. The Nuggets’ 144 points on 97 possessions in their win over the Sixers on Tuesday was the most efficient offensive performance for any team this season and the most efficient for the Nuggets in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data. It was also the first game in the 46 seasons of the 3-point line where a team shot at least 60% from the field, 50% on 30 3-point attempts and 90% on at least 25 free throw attempts.


That wasn’t the game in which Nikola Jokić put up an unprecedented line of 35 points, 22 rebounds and 17 assists (with just one turnover) and nailed a 66-foot shot. He did that against the Kings two nights later and is back to averaging a triple-double (29.9 points, 13.1 rebounds and 10.1 assists) for the season. He’s averaging a career-high 36.3 minutes per game, but with the addition of Russell Westbrook, Jokić has had the ball for just 12.4% of his minutes, his lowest rate in the last five seasons.

The Nuggets’ weekend loss in Minnesota was their worst of the season (29 points) and the start of a five-game trip that now takes them through the Eastern Conference. Their worst loss last season (38 points) was in New York and at the end of a five-game trip in January. They’ll return to Madison Square Garden on Wednesday.

After losing by 30 on Thursday, the Pacers blew a 17-point lead two days later. But they outscored the Spurs by 39 points (57-18) over the final 16 minutes to earn a split in the Paris games.
Three takeaways

The loss was one of their worst defensive games of the season, but the win on Saturday was the fourth time in their last seven games that the Pacers held their opponent under a point per possession, having done so just thrice in their first 38. They rank second defensively (107.6 allowed per 100) over the last three weeks.


Overall, they’ve been the league’s eighth most-improved defensive team, having allowed 3.9 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season. They’ve seen the second biggest drop in opponent free throw rate and its second biggest jump in defensive rebounding percentage. Andrew Nembhard (from 6% to 9.7%), Bennedict Mathurin (from 11.3% to 14.0%) and Obi Toppin (from 13.7% to 16.6%) have all seen big individual jumps in the latter.


A big difference between the two games in Paris was bench minutes, and the Pacers have now won 11 of the last 12 games in which they weren’t outscored with Toppin on the floor, with the only exception being a game in which he left early with an ankle injury. The Indiana bench ranks 14th over that stretch, up from 22nd prior.

The Pacers will have a few days to readjust to the Eastern time zone before playing a pair of big games within the No. 5-9 tier in the Eastern Conference. We’ve played 55% of the season without a Hawks-Pacers matchup, one that produced a 157-152 (regulation) game last season and a 131-130 game in the preseason.

The Clippers dropped a spot in the standings last week, but they took the Celtics to overtime without four of their five starters and are now 6-1 (with five straight wins) with Kawhi Leonard in uniform.
Three takeaways

The offense remains a bit of a struggle. The Clippers scored just 105.2 points per 100 possessions over their first three games last week, really coming up empty (90.9 per 100) after halftime. But their win over the Bucks on Saturday was just the fifth time that Milwaukee’s top-10 defense has allowed more than 120 points per 100 possessions. James Harden led the way with 40 points and nine assists (with just one turnover), two nights after recording his second triple-double of the season. He had 22 free throws over the two games and has now made his last 42 attempts from the stripe.


Leonard added 18 points and four assists on Saturday, though his minutes remain limited (less than 25 per game) and he’s yet to play in the fourth quarter. But only one of the seven games he’s played in (and only two of the Clippers’ last 13 overall) have been within five points in the last five minutes.


The Clippers are tied with the Kings for having the most home-heavy schedule (25/45) thus far. They have a losing record (9-11) on the road, having won just six of their last 17 games away from the Intuit Dome.

They’ll now head out on a four-game trip that begins with a big game in Phoenix on Monday. The Clippers scored just 18 points on 24 clutch possessions (with James Harden and Norman Powell both shooting 1-for-6 on clutch shots) as they lost two close games to the Suns (both in L.A.) in October.

The Wolves blew a fourth-quarter lead in Memphis last Monday, but recovered to get good wins over the Mavs (winning the season series) and Nuggets.
Three takeaways

With the 2-1 mark last week, the Wolves are 13-7 (third best) in games played between the top 10 teams in the Western Conference, allowing just 109.7 points per 100 possessions over those 20 games.


Overall, the defense has been inconsistent. That explains why the Wolves are 4-4 on a stretch where they rank fourth offensively (121.1 points scored per 100 possessions). Anthony Edwards has averaged 29.4 points over that stretch and Jaden McDaniels provided some unexpected offense in Dallas on Wednesday, scoring a career-high 27 points, even though he was just 1-for-5 from 3-point range.


Naz Reid is averaging more points (13.6 per game) and scoring more efficiently (true shooting percentage of 60.3%) than he did as the Kia Sixth Man of the Year last season. His 39-for-70 (55.7%) from 3-point range in January is the best mark among 180 players with at least 35 3-point attempts this month.

This is the seventh time that the Wolves have been three games over .500, and they’re 0-6 in opportunities to make it to four games over. Attempt No. 7 will come Monday against the Hawks, who beat the Wolves in December with a 35-19 fourth quarter.

The Bucks went 4-0 (with all five wins by 14 points or more) on a homestand, flew to New Orleans for a postponed game, and returned to Milwaukee just in time to beat the Heat by 29. So they may have been a little road-weary when they began a four-game trip with a loss to the Clippers on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The five-game winning streak was the Bucks’ best stretch of offense this season (125.2 points scored per 100 possessions) and had them in the top 10 on both ends of the floor before the loss in L.A. They committed just seven turnovers in each of the last two wins.


Having fallen back to 12th in offensive efficiency, the Bucks are still one of three teams — the Nuggets and Grizzlies are the others — that rank in the top 10 in three of the four factors on that end of the floor. Their issue is that they’re last (by a healthy margin) in offensive rebounding percentage (24.0%). And though they’ve ceded the offensive glass, they’re just 19th in transition points allowed per game.


Damian Lillard was just 1-for-9 from 3-point range against the Clippers after shooting 35-for-72 (49%) from beyond the arc over the previous nine games, but still had an efficient night by going 16-for-17 from the line. There have been three times in NBA history where a player has shot 92% or better on at least six free throw attempts per game: Lillard (92.8%) in 2020-21, Lillard (92.0%) last season, and Lillard (92.4%) this season.

The Bucks’ loss to the Clippers on Saturday began a stretch where they’re playing seven of eight games on the road. They’ll be at a rest disadvantage in Portland on Tuesday, currently 4-3 (0-2 on the road) in the second game of back-to-backs.

The Lakers have won five of their last six games to remain securely in the top six in the West. Their wins against the Wizards and Celtics last week came with their two largest margins of victory (21 and 23 points) this season.
Three takeaways

The 5-1 stretch has largely been about dominance inside, with the Lakers having outscored their opponents by an average of 17 points per game in the paint or at the free-throw line over the five wins. Anthony Davis averaged 29.7 points, 12.3 rebounds and 2.7 blocks over their three wins last week, doing most of that work inside, but also shooting 8-for-11 from mid-range.


LeBron James has an effective field goal percentage of 61.4% over the last five weeks, ranking fifth among 61 players with at least 200 field goal attempts over that stretch and is up from 54.5% before that. The Lakers have been better (both offensively and defensively) with James off the floor over that stretch. Dorian Finney-Smith’s minutes off the bench have been terrific, Gabe Vincent is finally giving them some consistent production, and Jarred Vanderbilt made his season debut on Saturday.


Even with their win at Golden State on Saturday, the Lakers have the league’s biggest home-road differentials regarding winning percentage (16-6 vs. 9-12) and point differential per 100 possessions (plus-3.8 vs. minus-6.8). And that road record breaks down to 4-1 in California and 5-11 elsewhere, with their four road wins since Dec. 2 having all come in Sacramento or San Francisco.

Their weekend win over the Warriors was the start of the Lakers’ longest road “trip” of the season (six games over 11 days), though (with the final game against the Clippers next week) they’ll be able to return home after their game in New York on Saturday.

The Mavs continue to beat the Thunder, but overall, they’ve lost 11 of their last 15 games, dropping from fourth to ninth place in the West over that stretch. Luka Dončić and Dereck Lively II remain out, and they’re now down another big, with Maxi Kleber suffering a foot fracture in their loss to the Celtics on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The team that eliminated the Thunder in last year’s Western Conference semifinals now accounts for three of Oklahoma City’s eight losses (and all three wins came without Dončić). As he was in the playoff series, P.J. Washington (who didn’t play in the Mavs’ one loss to the Thunder this season) was a big factor in the win on Thursday, scoring 22 points and grabbing 19 rebounds. Since May, he’s averaged 19 points and shot 30-for-62 (48%) from 3-point range in his nine games against Oklahoma City.


Sixteen of those 22 points on Thursday came in the paint or at the free-throw line, with Washington attacking the basket a lot more of late. He’s averaged 9.8 drives per game in January (with seven games of at least 10), twice as many as he averaged through Dec. 31 (4.9). For the season, the Mavs rank ninth in the percentage of their shots (49%) that have come in the paint, up from 29th (43%) last season.


The Mavs won the first 20 games that they led after the third quarter. But they’ve since lost three of the last five in which they held a lead entering the fourth, scoring just three points on their final nine possessions (shooting 1-for-12 with two turnovers) in Charlotte last Monday. Two nights later, they almost pulled off a fourth-quarter comeback against the Wolves but couldn’t get the final bucket they needed in the closing seconds. They’re in ninth place in the West but have the conference’s sixth-best point differential (that of a 28-18 team).

The Mavs’ longest road trip of the season (five games over nine days) begins Wednesday in New Orleans and includes games in Cleveland and Boston.

After winning 10 of 11 games, the Kings began a stretch where they’re playing 10 of their final 12 pre-break games on the road. That stretch began with losses in Denver and New York, taking them from seventh to 10th place in the West.
Three takeaways

The Kings have been better, statistically, under Doug Christie (plus-4.1 points per 100 possessions) than they were under Mike Brown (plus-1.6). But their recent success has also been about finding ways to win close games. Their win over the Warriors on Wednesday was their sixth straight in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, with the Kings scoring 85 points on 65 clutch possessions (1.35 per) over that stretch.


Their loss in Denver the following night counted as a clutch loss, though there was only a single (Nuggets) clutch possession after the Kings cut a 25-point deficit down to five late. In total, they’re 6-1 in clutch games under Christie after going 6-13 in clutch games under Brown.


Bench minutes were rough over the two losses, but the Kings have still been at their best (plus-7.4 points per 100 possessions) with Keon Ellis on the floor. The reserve guard doesn’t shoot a lot (he ranks last among their rotation guys in usage rate) but he’s now 145-for-335 (43.3%) from 3-point range over his three-year career, with that being the second-best mark among 287 players with at least 250 3-point attempts over the last three seasons. His effective field goal percentage of 69.5% in January also ranks sixth among 194 players with at least 75 field goal attempts this month.

The Kings’ six-game trip continues in Brooklyn on Monday, the start of a stretch where they are playing seven of their final 10 pre-break games against teams that rank in the bottom seven offensively.

The Suns got clobbered in Cleveland last Monday, but they’re 8-3 since moving Bradley Beal to the bench.
Three takeaways

The Suns are now 18-5 in games that Ryan Dunn, Kevin Durant and Devin Booker have played together. They’ve outscored their opponents by 11.9 points per 100 possessions in that trio’s 243 minutes on the floor. But Dunn sprained his ankle less than two minutes into their win against the Wizards over the weekend and is out for (at least) their game against the Clippers on Monday.


The Suns don’t rank in the top 10 on either end of the floor over the 8-3 stretch, but they have won five of their six games that have been within five points in the last five minutes, holding their opponents to just 21 points on 24 clutch possessions. Beal may be coming off the bench, but he’s been on the floor down the stretch of the four close games he was available for.


It’s not great that the game against the worst team in the league was one of those within five in the last five, but the win over Washington ended a streak of 13 straight games in which the Suns had fewer shooting opportunities than their opponents. They had three more turnovers than the Wizards but held them to just five offensive rebounds — the Suns’ season-low for an opponent. Over his four games with the team, the Suns have grabbed 56.1% of available rebounds with Nick Richards on the floor and just 43.5% with him off the floor.

Having played 11 of their last 12 games against the Eastern Conference, the Suns will now play 11 straight within the West. That includes a pair of huge games against the Clippers and Wolves this week.

Jimmy Butler was suspended for another road trip and the Heat fell below .500 before getting a much-needed win in Brooklyn on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Heat have scored just 105.7 points per 100 possessions over the 12 games that Butler has missed since Christmas. Their 29-point loss in Milwaukee on Thursday marked the fourth time they’ve been held under a point per possession over that stretch. They’re 6-6 in those 12 games, but only the Magic, Nets, Wizards and Hornets have been worse offensively since Christmas.


The offense might be better if the Miami defense could force some turnovers. The loss in Milwaukee was also the fourth time in a five-game stretch in which their opponents committed eight or fewer. The Heat rank 18th in opponent turnover rate (14.4 per 100 possessions), having ranked in the top 10 in each of the last four seasons.


Rookie Kel’el Ware is now in the starting lineup, though he’s still played just 59 total minutes alongside Bam Adebayo. Ware had two more 20-point games last week (he’s one of five rookies with at least four), but the offense has been ugly on both ends of the floor (94.5 combined points per 100 possessions) in those double-big minutes.

The Heat are 2-5 in games played between the four East teams (6-9 in the standings) that are within a game of .500, needing a win against the Magic on Monday to even the season series. The last meeting came with a Herro game-winner and the least efficient offensive performance (the Heat’s 89 points on 96 possessions) for a winning team this season.

The Magic got Franz Wagner (from a 20-game absence) and Jalen Suggs (from a 10-game absence) back last week, and they got a huge win over the Pistons on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Magic scored an anemic 95.4 points per 100 possessions over the five-game losing streak that preceded the win on Saturday. Their offensive issues are a little about turnovers, but mostly about shooting, as they rank first in free throw rate and ninth in offensive rebounding percentage.


Shooting 15-for-33 (45%) from beyond the arc in the win over Detroit, the Magic remain the league’s only undefeated team when they’ve shot the league average (36.0%) or better from 3-point range. Of course, they’ve done so in just nine of their 47 games, with every other team having shot 36% or better at least 16 times. They were 5-for-5 from 3-point range through the first nine minutes in Toronto on Tuesday … and they were 4-for-26 thereafter as a 21-point lead became a 16-point loss.


But because they have the league’s lowest opponent 3-point rate (just 38% of their opponents’ shots) by a wide margin, Saturday was the 21st time the Magic (13-8 in those games) have outscored their opponent from beyond the arc. Wagner and Paolo Banchero were a combined 7-for-14 from deep as they each scored 30-plus points in the same game for just the second time (the first since Nov. of 2022) in 155 total games together.

The Magic will play another huge game within the 6-9 group in the East when they visit Miami on Monday, with Suggs (quad contusion suffered in his return over the weekend) listed as questionable. That’s the start of their longest road trip of the season (six games over 11 days), which will then take them West.

The Pistons won the first two games of their five-game trip (including one in Houston). But, they lost the most important game of the five as they couldn’t stop the Magic’s 29th-ranked offense on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Over the first two games of the trip, the Pistons held the Rockets and Hawks to just 96.2 points per 100 possessions. They have the league’s third-ranked defense in January after ranking 28th on defense in December. Seven of their 13 January games have come against teams that rank in the bottom 10 offensively, but Monday’s win was also the least efficient performance for the Rockets’ ninth-ranked offense since early December.


Alas, in a game that could help determine the final guaranteed playoff spot in the East, the Magic had their best 3-point shooting game since November, spoiling a huge offensive performance (35 points and 11 assists) from Cade Cunningham. With the Pistons protecting the paint much better than in 2023-24, they’ve seen the league’s fourth-biggest jump in the percentage of their opponents’ shots taken from 3-point range.


The Pistons’ starting lineup (with Ausar Thompson) has outscored opponents by 11.6 points per 100 possessions in its 108 minutes since Jaden Ivey’s injury. But Malik Beasley has played more minutes than two of the five starters over that stretch, and he’s been the best complement for Cunningham regarding how well the Pistons have played with the point guard (likely to get his first All-Star nod this week) on the floor.

Despite the loss in Orlando, the Pistons are the only team with a winning record (13-11) on the road and a losing record (10-11) at home. Their longest road trip of the season concludes with visits to Cleveland and Indiana, and they then begin their longest homestand of the season (six games over 10 days).

The Warriors remain outside the SoFi Play-In Tournament group in the West, losing a couple of games (to the Kings and Lakers) that could have helped them last week.
Three takeaways

Draymond Green has played just three minutes over the last eight games, and the Warriors have unsurprisingly seen some defensive slippage. They’ve allowed 121.1 points per 100 possessions over the last six, including 129.4 per 100 after halftime. They blew a 19-point lead in Sacramento and saw their game against the Lakers get away early in the third quarter on Saturday.


The other end of the floor has been the larger issue, with the Warriors having seen the league’s eighth-biggest drop in points per 100 possessions (-5.2) from last season when they ranked ninth offensively. Stephen Curry may be feeling the offensive burden he’s been trying to carry, having shot just 40% (33% from 3-point range) over his last eight games.


The Warriors have been rebounding pretty well. They’ve outscored their opponents by 50 points (98-48) on second chances over their last five games, with Trayce Jackson-Davis, Gui Santos and Kevon Looney all having grabbed at least 10 offensive boards over that stretch.

The Warriors have four games left on their six-game homestand and they’ll face the Jazz twice in the next 10 days, currently 5-0 against the bottom three teams in the West.

The Hawks are back on the downswing, losing four straight games for the first time since Week 2.
Three takeaways

The Hawks have scored just 101.7 points per 100 possessions over the losing streak, even though the opponents — New York, Detroit and Toronto (x 2) — rank no higher than 13th defensively. The second of their two losses to the Raptors was Atlanta’s worst offensive performance of the season (94 on 109) and De’Andre Hunter now has an effective field goal percentage of 43.5% in January, sixth worst among 136 players with at least 100 field goal attempts this month and down from 60.4% through Dec. 31.


For the season, the Hawks have seen the league’s sixth-biggest drop in points scored per 100 possessions (-5.6). It’s news that they aren’t in the bottom 10 defensively, but it’s also news that they are in the bottom 10 on offense, having had the league’s sixth-best offense over the previous four seasons.


Jalen Johnson suffered a left shoulder injury in the first half of the first of the two losses to Toronto. The Hawks have yet to provide a timeline for the fourth-year forward, who could be named an All-Star reserve this week. Johnson’s on-off differential has gone down in the last few weeks, but Atlanta has still been outscored by 8.6 points per 100 possessions in his 891 minutes off the floor.

With the Hawks’ game against the Rockets rescheduled for Tuesday, it’s now the end of a stretch of five games in seven days and in the middle of a tough week where they’re visiting the Wolves, Cavs and Pacers.

Having split their two games in Paris, the Spurs are just 2-7 over the last 23 days and two games out of a SoFi Play-In Tournament spot in the West.
Three takeaways

The Spurs rank 29th defensively (119.9 points allowed per 100 possessions) over the 2-7 stretch. As usual, they’ve been much better with Victor Wembanyama on the floor (115.3 allowed per 100) than they’ve been with him off the floor (123.5) over the nine games, though that former number is still well above the league average.


A season-high 24 turnovers (14 of them live balls) didn’t help the defense on Saturday. The Spurs have committed more turnovers than their opponents in five straight games and their season-long differential (1.8 per game more than their opponents) ranks 27th and is exactly what it was last season. They’ve committed just 13.6 turnovers per 100 possessions with Chris Paul on the floor, but 15.9 per 100 with him off the floor.


Harrison Barnes was a bright spot in Paris, totaling 45 points on 18-for-25 shooting over the two games. Barnes’ usage rate (14.7%) is tied for the lowest of his career, but he’s registering career-best marks in effective field goal percentage (59.6%) and true shooting percentage (63.8%).

The Sixers have followed a seven-game losing streak with two straight wins, and they were both pretty big. The first (vs. Cleveland) was maybe their best win of the season and the second (at Chicago) pulled them into a tie in the loss column with the 10th-place Bulls for the final SoFi Play-In Tournament spot in the East.
Three takeaways

The win in Chicago (their first win in the second game of a back-to-back) was also, statistically, the Sixers’ best defensive game (97 points allowed on 102 possessions) without Joel Embiid, who’s now missed the last 11 games. They’ve still rank 29th defensively and last in total rebounding percentage over his absence. The Nuggets’ 144 points on 97 possessions on Tuesday was the most efficient performance for any team this season.


Eric Gordon hit two huge 3-pointers on a 13-0, fourth-quarter run that turned a six-point deficit into a seven-point lead against Cleveland on Friday. The 36-year-old got off to a little bit of a rough start this season but is one of three Sixers who’ve played in each of the last 10 games and has shot 28-for-54 (52%) from beyond the arc over that stretch.


The Sixers still have the league’s biggest differential between their record against the 13 teams currently at or below .500 (12-4) and their record against the 17 teams currently over .500 (5-23). They got some schedule relief with the win in Chicago, but the relief was brief.

Seven of their next eight games are against teams with winning records, with the one exception being a game against the .500 Heat. That’s the end of the Sixers’ longest homestand of the season (six games over nine days), which begins Tuesday with a visit from the Lakers and includes two back-to-backs.

The Blazers put together their first four-game winning streak since the start of the 2022-23 season before losing a somewhat competitive game against the Thunder on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Blazers allowed just 99.2 points per 100 possessions over the winning streak, easily their best stretch of defense this season. They weren’t facing great offenses, but it was the last four games of a stretch of five games in seven days and allowing less than a point per possession over any stretch is a huge accomplishment for this group.


The Blazers’ three centers — Deandre Ayton, Donovan Clingan and Robert Williams III — have all been in and out of the lineup. Roughly 65 of the 192 minutes during the winning streak came with none of the three on the floor and Jerami Grant or Jabari Walker at the five. Grant has shot just 37% over the six games since his return from a nine-game absence, but the Blazers have outscored their opponents by 15.1 points per 100 possessions in his 186 minutes.


The Blazers are now 8-9 (6-2 with Grant in uniform) since Christmas, though they still rank in the bottom 10 on both ends of the floor (21st offensively, 22nd defensively) over that stretch because five of the nine losses have been by 18 points or more.

The Blazers’ loss to Oklahoma City on Sunday was the start of their first of two seven-game homestands. They’ll have rest advantages against the Bucks and Suns this week.

The Raptors have suddenly won five of their last six games, picking up their second and third road wins of the season in Atlanta.
Three takeaways

The bigger difference between the 5-1 stretch and the preceding five-game losing streak has been on defense, where the Raptors have allowed just 106.4 points per 100 possessions over the six games. The opponents have shot 51.7% in the paint, down from 59.4% through the Raptors’ first 39 games.


On the other end of the floor, six Raptors have averaged in double-figures over the six games. Scottie Barnes has led the way, averaging 19.5 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.2 assists, and Toronto has been 33 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (plus-13.8) than it has been with him off the floor (minus-19.2) over this stretch.


Before last week, the Raptors were 0-27 in games they trailed by double-digits. But after trailing by 21 in the first quarter on Tuesday, they outscored the Magic by 39 points (98-59) over the final 40 minutes. And after falling into an early, 12-point hole in their second game in Atlanta, they outscored the Hawks by 35 (102-67) over the final 37:30. Those games were also the first two times since Thanksgiving that the Raptors held their opponent to a point per possession or less.

The most recent occasion before that was also the Raptors’ only road win before Thursday, a 26-point victory in New Orleans in late November. They’ll host the Pelicans (last place in the West) on Monday and then pay a visit to the last-place team in the East.

The Pelicans began Week 14 by extending their season-best winning streak to four games. They ended it with a 31-point loss to the Hornets.
Three takeaways

With their loss in Memphis on Friday, the Pels became the first team to match its loss total from last season (49-33), and they surpassed it in Charlotte the following night. The two losses were the Grizzlies’ best offensive performance (139 points on 99 possessions) and the Hornets’ second-best offensive performance (123 on 100) of the season.


CJ McCollum scored 45 points in the Pelicans’ overtime win over Utah last Monday, shooting 5-for-7 on pull-up 2-pointers. He had a rough night in Charlotte over the weekend, but still has an effective field goal percentage of 57.5% since Christmas, up from just 50.0% prior. He’s registering career-high marks for both field goal percentage in the paint (55.3%) and the percentage of his shots that have come in the paint (41%), though his season-long effective field goal percentage (53.6%) is still down from a career-best mark of 57.2% last season.


The Pelicans had won seven of 10 before Friday, but with the weekend losses, they’re 11 1/2 games out of a SoFI Play-In Tournament spot, they’re just 4-21 against the 17 teams currently over .500, and they have a tough stretch of schedule coming up.

After their three-game trip wraps in Toronto on Monday, they’ll finish their pre-break schedule with eight games against the Mavs, Celtics, Nuggets (x 2), Kings (x 3) and Thunder.

The Bulls got a good win in L.A. last Monday (the end of a stretch of five games in seven days), but have lost seven of their last eight games.
Three takeaways

The Bulls are holding the door to the Eastern Conference Play-In Club wide open for the 11th-place Sixers, to whom they lost (with a rest advantage) on Saturday. They’ve scored 96.1 points per 100 possessions over their two losses to Philly, with two more (both in Philadelphia) coming after the All-Star break. The Bulls are now just 10-12 against the other 12 teams that are currently at or below .500, with a 6-5 mark against the five teams behind them in the Eastern Conference standings.


The offense has also been the larger issue over this 1-7 stretch, with the Bulls scoring just 106.8 points per 100 possessions over the eight games (including just 90.9 per 100 over the eight fourth quarters). Coby White has missed four of the eight games (including the last three), but five of the eight have also come against teams that rank in the bottom half of the league defensively.


With White out, Lonzo Ball (who’s taken 85% of his shots from 3-point range) has been in the starting lineup. The Bulls have outscored their opponents by 40 points (19.9 per 100 possessions) in 110 total minutes with Ball on the floor with four of five regular starters and in place of White or Josh Giddey.

The only team behind them in the East that the Bulls haven’t lost to is the Raptors (1-0), who they’ll visit on Friday in the second game of a three-game trip.

The Hornets split the first two games of their nine-game homestand (both within the bottom seven of the league), losing to the Blazers without LaMelo Ball and Miles Bridges and beating the Pelicans handily with both back in the lineup.
Three takeaways

The Hornets have quietly risen into the top half of the league defensively. They’ve seen the league’s third biggest drop in points allowed per 100 possessions from last season (-6.3), with a change in scheme (more switching) helping them see a huge drop in opponent drives.


Nick Richards was their best rim protector, but they’ve been at their best defensively (104.3 points allowed per 100 possessions) with Moussa Diabate on the floor. The two-way player has been back in the rotation for the last five games and even played a few minutes next to Mark Williams in the loss to Portland on Friday.


The Hornets announced on Thursday that Brandon Miller is done for the season after having surgery on his right wrist. So over Miller’s first two seasons in the league, he played just 254 minutes (in 18 games) alongside both Ball and Williams. The Hornets outscored their opponents by 4.0 points per 100 possessions in those 254 minutes.

The Hornets still have seven games left on their nine-game homestand, with another game within the bottom seven in the league on Wednesday, when they’ll host the Nets.

The Jazz were tied in Oklahoma City with a little more than five minutes to go on Wednesday, but couldn’t finish and now have their fourth losing streak of (at least) five games.
Three takeaways

In their two meetings, the Jazz have committed 37 more turnovers (56-19) than the Thunder. While Oklahoma City has the best turnover differential by a wide margin (6.6 per game fewer than their opponents) in the 48 seasons for which turnovers have been counted, Utah has the worst by a wide margin (5.8 per game more). The good news is that the Jazz have committed fewer or the same number of turnovers as their opponent in four of their last six games.


John Collins returned from an eight-game absence on Wednesday when the Jazz’s reunited starting lineup outscored the Thunder by nine points in its 16.4 minutes. In 184 total minutes this season, the lineup has outscored opponents by 6.3 points per 100 possessions. After a one-game return, Collins missed the Jazz’s loss in Memphis with an illness over the weekend and is listed as questionable for their game against the Bucks on Monday.


With the Raptors getting a couple of comeback wins last week, the Jazz are the only team without a win (they’re 0-30) after trailing by double-digits. Only one team in the previous 28 seasons for which we have play-by-play data — the 0-35, 1998-99 Clippers — went winless in games they trailed by double-digits, and that was in a lockout-shortened, 50-game season.

The Jazz have played the league’s most road-heavy schedule to date, with only 18 of their 43 games having come at the Delta Center. They’ve been better on the road (7-18) than they’ve been at home (3-15), but will be home for 13 of 16 beginning with a visit from the Wolves on Thursday.

The Nets had a competitive game against the Knicks last week, but have their longest losing streak of the season (six games).
Three takeaways

Is it more amazing that the Nets ranked eighth offensively through their first 20 games or that they fell to 27th in that category? They’re now one of two teams (the Wizards are the other) that rank in the bottom five in both offensive and defensive efficiency.


Cam Johnson looked sharp in his Vince Carter North Carolina jersey on Saturday, but his team probably would have been sharper if he were wearing a Nets jersey instead. They’re now 0-11 without him, having scored just 96.9 points per 100 possessions over those 11 games. He’s now missed nine of the last 12.


Dariq Whitehead is still healing from a leg issue (suffered last season) and has mostly been playing in the NBA G League, but the Nets’ loss to Phoenix on Wednesday was the second time this season that he’s played more than 10 minutes on this level. In those two games (the first was Dec. 2), he’s totaled 30 points, shooting 9-for-15 from 3-point range.

The Nets are 4-3 in games played between the bottom seven teams in the league, with a one-point win (behind 34 points from Johnson) over the Hornets included. The 12th and 14th-place teams in the East will meet twice more before the All-Star break, with the first of those meetings in Charlotte on Wednesday.

The Wizards’ latest losing streak is at 13 games, and they still haven’t won a road game since October.
Three takeaways

The Wizards’ starting lineup cracked the 200-minute mark last week and has been outscored by an amazing 33.5 points per 100 possessions. With that, they finally made a change, replacing Bub Carrington with fellow rookie Kyshawn George on Saturday. The new group outscored the Suns by two points in a little more than 20 minutes, and Carrington had a relatively good game (11 points on 4-for-9 shooting, two assists and no turnovers) off the bench.


The new lineup certainly got a boost from Kyle Kuzma finally breaking out offensively. He scored a season-high 30 points (shooting 5-for-9 from 3-point range) in the loss. The Wizards continue to have four of the 17 players (George, Alex Sarr, Bilal Coulibaly and Kuzma) with an effective field goal percentage of 47.0% or worse on at least 200 shots.


Concerning where they rank shooting-wise, the Wizards have been slightly better in the paint (25th) than from mid-range (28th) or 3-point range (29th). But they’ve now shot 50% or worse in the paint in seven of their last 10 games. Jordan Poole remains the second-best pull-up 3-point shooter in the league, but he’s just 21-for-55 (38%) inside the arc over his last nine.

The Wizards will wrap up their six-game trip with a visit to Dallas on Monday. Then they’ll face the 13th-place Raptors for the first time, and they’ll have a chance to end their 25-game losing streak in the second game of back-to-backs when they host the Lakers on Thursday night.

Are the Warriors OK with spending one of the few years Stephen Curry has left hovering around the middle of the West? Or, will they mortgage some portion of the post-Curry future to bring in a real difference-maker (like, oh say, Jimmy Butler)?

And since that loss knocked them below .500 and continued a troubling trend of Paolo Banchero playing wildly inefficient basketball, it'd probably be fair to bump Orlando down a few spots.
They're hanging on (at least for now) because of the active, athletic defense that had them 15-7 earlier in the season and an earlier-than-expected return from Franz Wagner.
On the season, the Magic have a point differential around that of a 59-win team when Franz is on the floor and one one around that of a 26-win team when he's not.

On Thursday, Jaren Jackson Jr. was named to his second career All-Star team. And later, he helped his Memphis Grizzlies get off the schneid against the Houston Rockets (were 3-0 against Memphis this season).
Last season was undoubtedly rough for the Grizzlies. But in hindsight, it helped develop this version of Jackson and set Memphis up for a brighter long-term future.
His willingness and ability to do a little more as an alpha scorer has allowed the team to be ultra-conservative with Ja Morant's health all season. His outside shooting pulls bigs out of the paint and widens driving lanes for his teammates. And his range as a rim protector allows everyone else to be a little more aggressive outside."

It's been a disappointing several weeks for the reigning-champion Boston Celtics, who are 7-6 in their last 13 and 14-11 in their last 25.
But they looked more like their formerly dominant selves against the Zach LaVine-less Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, thanks in large part to a big night from Kristaps Porziņģis.
The big man had 34 points and eight threes, and Boston is now 4-0 when he scores at least 23 points."

The Houston Rockets ended their week with a one-point road loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, but they were without first-time All-Star Alperen Şengün in that one, and they'd already done enough to creep one spot higher in the rankings.
Houston is 10-3 in its last 13 games. During the 10-game stretch that preceded Thursday's loss, they beat the Grizzlies (twice), Denver Nuggets, Cleveland Cavaliers (twice) and Boston Celtics on an Amen Thompson buzzer-beater.
And speaking of Thompson, his breakout as a permanent fixture of the starting five should have Rockets fans feeling wildly optimistic about the team's prospects this season.
Over his last 16 games, Thompson is averaging 17.3 points, 10.3 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.9 steals and 1.6 blocks. The addition of his playmaking, defense and finishing to lineups with Şengün, Jalen Green and Fred VanVleet has Houston flummoxing the best teams in the league.
And while it's far from a given that that will keep happening in the playoffs, the Rockets have shown enough to know they'll at least be competitive against everyone."

The Cleveland Cavaliers have looked a bit closer to mortal since the calendar flipped to 2025, but they're still the runaway first seed in the East. And they rightfully have three players representing the conference in the All-Star game.
In fact, there might even be an argument that Jarrett Allen should be joining Evan Mobley, Darius Garland and Donovan Mitchell in San Francisco.
This season, when you sort every qualified player by the average of their ranks in eight catch-all metrics, Garland, Mitchell, Mobley and Allen come in at ninth, 12th, 16th and 18th, respectively."

Chet Holmgren is back and the Thunder continue to run away with the top seed in the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

Holmgren returned on Friday, started alongside Isaiah Hartenstein and played more than 19 of his 22 minutes alongside either Hartenstein or Jaylin Williams (in part because Lu Dort was out). Holmgren blocked four shots and the Thunder held the Raptors under a point per possession (38 on 40) in those two-big configurations.


Holmgren didn’t play in the second game of the Thunder’s weekend back-to-back, but the Thunder still beat the second-place Grizzlies handily, expanding their lead at the top of the West to eight games in the loss column. With Dort still out, Alex Caruso got his first start and played a season-high 27 minutes. Though he’s come off the bench in 30 of his 31 games, the teammate he’s played alongside most is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and the Thunder have outscored their opponents by an amazing 27.2 points per 100 possessions in their 351 minutes together.


Gilgeous-Alexander’s free throw rate (40.8 attempts per 100 shots from the field) is his lowest in the last three seasons, but he’s 38-for-42 from the line over the last three games. He scored 50 (for the third time in a seven-game stretch) in a win over Phoenix on Wednesday, which was also the 14th time that the Thunder had at least 10 fewer turnovers than their opponent. That’s just one shy of the most such games for any team in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data.

Two of the previous 13 games in which they had at least 10 fewer turnovers than their opponent came against the Pelicans and Wolves, who they will face this week.

The Celtics lost at home to Dallas on Thursday, but won their two much more important games of the week, beating the Cavs and Knicks on the road.
Three takeaways

The two big wins were different. The Cleveland game was kind of ugly, with the two teams combining for just 10 points in the first six minutes. The New York game was another offensive blitz led by Jayson Tatum (40 points) and Payton Pritchard (25 on 9-for-13 shooting). The Celtics remain the only team in the top five on both ends of the floor.


Whether he’s the third big in the rotation or the first, Luke Kornet continues to make an impact. He was on the floor for much of the Celtics’ huge comeback in Philadelphia eight days ago. He provided more big minutes off the bench in Cleveland on Tuesday, when the Celtics were outscored by 15 points in the starting lineup’s 15.3 minutes. And in New York (with Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis out), Kornet was in the starting lineup, tallying 14 points (on 7-for-7 shooting), 12 rebounds and three blocks. The Celtics have been at their best this season (plus 14.8 points per 100 possessions) with Kornet on the floor.


The Celtics somehow lost a game (to the Mavs) in which they outscored their opponent by 26 points in the restricted area and by three from beyond the arc. They are fifth in the league in the (lowest) percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come from the restricted area or 3-point range but can be beaten when their opponent shoots well in between. The loss on Thursday was the seventh time their opponent has shot better than 55% on non-restricted-area 2-point shots, with the Celtics 3-4 in those games.

The Celtics have won their last four meetings with the Spurs, with the last three wins coming by an average of 32 points. Their first meeting of the season is their last game before the All-Star break, Wednesday in Boston.

The Cavs are the only one of the top seven teams in the league that made a significant move at the deadline, acquiring De’Andre Hunter from Atlanta for Caris LeVert, Georges Niang and picks.
Three takeaways

The Cavs are a league-best 31-1 when they’ve won the first quarter, but they got off to a rough start against the Celtics last week, scoring just 15 points on 26 first-quarter possessions. Their historically efficient offense is No. 1 in both field goal percentage in the paint (60.9%) and 3-point percentage (39.5%), with the loss on Tuesday just the second time they made less than half of their shots (19-for-41) in the paint and just the fourth time they shot below 30% from beyond the arc.


They got off to a better start two nights later in Detroit but somehow lost a 10-point lead with less than 45 seconds left. And then Darius Garland beat the buzzer with a 31-footer to win the game, improving to 7-for-12 on clutch 3-pointers. The Cavs are a league-best 16-6 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, and their 141.8 points scored per 100 clutch possessions would be the best mark for any team in the 29 seasons for which we have clutch data.


Like LeVert (who shot 0-for-13 in his last two games with the Cavs), Hunter has cooled off, shooting less than 40% over the last 5 1/2 weeks. He’s still registering career highs for both effective field goal percentage (56%) and free throw rate (35.8 attempts per 100 shots from the field). The latter would be the second highest among the 10 Cavs with at least 100 field goal attempts, trailing only that of Jarrett Allen (42.9 per 100).

The last time the Cavs won after losing the first quarter was in Minnesota on Jan. 18, when they got big minutes from their bench. Hunter will make his Cavs debut when they complete the season series with the Wolves on Monday.

The Nuggets have been shorthanded, but they’ve won six straight games, climbing into third place in the West.
Three takeaways

The Nuggets’ fourth-ranked offense has done a lot of the work (127.5 points scored per 100 possessions) over the winning streak. Nikola Jokić has led the way, but Michael Porter Jr. has been on a heater, averaging 35 points on 64% shooting (including 17-for-29 from 3-point range) over his last three games. With Porter (hamstring) missing their game in Phoenix on Saturday, Jamal Murray made a season-high six 3-pointers on nine attempts.


The Nuggets have been without Russell Westbrook for their five February games, but haven’t needed him to outscore their opponents by 72 points (128-56) on fast breaks over that stretch. Christian Braun (9.0) and Porter (8.3) rank first and third in fast break points per game this month, with Braun (5.3) now in a close race with Giannis Antetokounmpo (5.4) for the season-long league lead.


According to Synergy tracking, the Nuggets have seen the league’s third-biggest jump in transition points per game from last season (19.4, 23rd) to this season (26.2, fourth). That’s helped them be one of only eight teams that have scored more points per 100 possessions than they did last season when they ranked fifth offensively.

The competition hasn’t been great over these last six games, but the league’s No. 2 offense in the last three weeks will now face the league’s top-ranked defense over that span, with the Nuggets hosting the Blazers for a two-game set to close their pre-break schedule.

The Knicks have had some quality wins in the last few weeks, but they continue to struggled against the best of the best, getting clobbered by the Celtics at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night.
Three takeaways

The Knicks are 0-5 against the Celtics, Cavs and Thunder, having allowed 126.7 points per 100 possessions over the five games. Their two worst defensive games of the season — the first on opening night, the second on Saturday — have come with Boston shooting 48-for-100 from 3-point range.


The Knicks rank last in opponent 3-point percentage (38%). The percentage of their opponents’ 3-point attempts that have been wide-open (48%) is actually below average, but their opponents have shot relatively well (41.5%) on those wide-open 3-pointers.


It certainly didn’t help that the Knicks were without OG Anunoby on Saturday. The last four games (starting with the one in which he was injured) have been the team’s worst four-game stretch of defense this season (125.5 points allowed per 100 possessions), they’re now 6-4 when they’ve been without (at least) one of their five starters, and it was a little surprising that they didn’t add any wing depth at the deadline.

After the two losses to the Celtics, the Knicks’ worst defensive game of the season came in Indiana in November. They’re 1-1 against the team that eliminated them from last year’s playoffs, and their visit to Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Tuesday will be the final meeting of the regular season.

OffRtg: 118.1 (5) DefRtg: 110.8 (7) NetRtg: +7.3 (4) Pace: 104.5 (1)
The Grizzlies, who are having the best season (statistically) in franchise history, took a purposeful step backward at the deadline. It was one thing to dump the contract of Marcus Smart (who played only 39 games for them), but they also sent Jake LaRavia (a solid contributor and much-improved player this season) to Sacramento.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies had won 10 of their last 11 games before Saturday, and then they ran into the Thunder. Memphis is now 6-10 (third worst) in games played between the eight Western Conference teams with winning records and has trailed both games against the first-place Thunder by at least 28 points.


The Grizzlies rank second in total rebounding percentage, but in their last two losses (at New York, vs. Oklahoma City), they’ve been destroyed in the possession game. They had 17 fewer shooting opportunities than the Knicks and 16 fewer than the Thunder. Overall, they rank 12th in shooting opportunity differential at +0.7 per game.


Maybe LaRavia was expendable because GG Jackson (three years young and two inches taller) has been available for the last 10 games after missing the first 42. The defense has been bad (125.3 points per 100 possessions) in Jackson’s 179 minutes on the floor, but the 20-year-old scored a season-high 27 points off the bench in the Grizzlies’ win over the Spurs last Monday.

The second-place Grizzlies are now closer in losses to the seventh-place Clippers than they are to the first-place Thunder. They lost the first meeting with the Clips (an ugly nail-biter) and will be at a rest disadvantage when they visit Intuit Dome on Wednesday.

Luka Dončić has yet to make his Lakers debut, but his new team has been doing just fine without him. The Lakers have won 11 of their last 13 games, climbing from seventh (and past Dončić’s former team) to fifth in the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

The Lakers rank third defensively over the 11-2 stretch, having allowed 108.3 points per 100 possessions over the 13 games. The context is that 10 of the 13 have come against teams that rank in the bottom 13 offensively and the numbers are a little skewed by two games against the 30th-ranked Wizards in which the Lakers allowed just 90.2 per 100.


Still, it’s a big improvement from where the Lakers were defensively (24th, 115.7 allowed per 100) through their first 37 games. They’ve seen huge drops in both opponent field goal percentage in the paint and the percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come in the paint.


With the Mark Williams trade falling apart, the Lakers are left with Jaxson Hayes as their one real lob threat to complement Dončić. The good news is that, with guys like Dorian Finney-Smith, Rui Hachimura and Jarred Vanderbilt likely to play many minutes at the five, they could be better with their switching defense. They currently rank second in the percentage of ball screens (36%) that they’ve switched but are 25th in points allowed per possession when switching, per Second Spectrum tracking.

The Lakers are one of three undefeated teams (9-0) against the bottom six teams in the league (those with fewer than 20 wins), though their two wins over the Jazz have come by a total of just seven points. They’ll complete the season series (and their pre-break schedule) with a home-and-home set this week, with Dončić (and LeBron James) listed as questionable for the game in L.A. on Monday.

The Rockets stood pat at the deadline, which landed amid a six-game losing streak that included an absolutely brutal finish in Brooklyn on Tuesday.
Three takeaways

The losing streak was the Rockets’ worst stretch of defense this season (121 points allowed per 100 possessions). Their opponents shot relatively well, but the Rockets also struggled to force turnovers and secure the defensive glass.


The rebounding issue goes back to the absence of Jabari Smith Jr. for the last 20 games. Amen Thompson has shined as Smith’s replacement in the starting lineup, but the Rockets have grabbed just 67.7% of available defensive rebounds with Smith off the floor, compared to 74.4% with him on the floor. They’ve ranked 28th in defensive rebounding percentage over his absence, down from 11th prior.


It should be noted that the losing streak came near the end of a stretch where the Rockets played 10 games in 16 days in nine different arenas. They returned home and got an ugly win over Toronto on Sunday, the end of their second (and final) stretch of five games in seven days. They had one of their best defensive rebounding games of the season but were helped in that regard by the absence of Jakob Poeltl for the Raptors.

The win was also the start of a stretch where the Rockets are playing 13 of 17 games at home. They may be the team most in need of the All-Star break, but they should have at least one hungry opponent in town this week.

After an ugly start to their five-game homestand, the Wolves won the last three games, climbing into the top six in the West.
Three takeaways

Anthony Edwards does not miss many games (eight total over the last three seasons) and his first absence this season (nine days ago) resulted in a loss to the Wizards. But the Wolves beat the red-hot Blazers without their All-Star on Saturday, holding their opponent under a point per possession for the 12th time this season. That’s tied for second most in the league, though not quite on pace to match their total from last season (20 games).


Naz Reid has started the last five games in place of the injured Julius Randle, and the Wolves have been at their best (plus 17.2 points per 100 possessions) with Reid on the floor over that stretch. They’ve now allowed just 102.9 per 100 in 698 total minutes with Reid and Rudy Gobert on the floor together.


The Wolves rank 27th in the percentage of their minutes (4%) coming from rookies or second-year players, but most of those minutes have come in the last 3 1/2 weeks. Rob Dillingham has been in the rotation for the last 13 games, Jaylen Clark has been getting some burn with guys out, and Terrence Shannon Jr. also saw some playing time last week. Clark and Shannon were a combined 6-for-10 from 3-point range in the Wolves’ win over the Rockets on Thursday.

The Wolves are currently 12-11 (fifth best) in games played between the 14 teams currently over .500, set to face the first-place teams in each conference this week. They’re 0-1 against both Cleveland and Oklahoma City, with both games being within five points in the last five minutes.

The Pacers have cooled off a bit, going 2-2 on a trip out West, though they remain in fourth place in the East.
Three takeaways

The trip was the Pacers’ worst four-game stretch of offense (108.2 points scored per 100 possessions) since early December. It wasn’t a good trip for anybody but All-Star Pascal Siakam, who averaged 23.5 points on 53% shooting over the four games. The rest of the roster had an effective field goal percentage of just 48.4% and with their loss in Portland on Tuesday, the Pacers are 2-11 when Tyrese Haliburton has registered an effective field goal percentage of 40% or worse.


The offense was especially anemic early in games, and the Pacers were outscored by 59 points (145-86) over the four first quarters on the trip. They managed to come back from 15 points down in Utah and from 22 points down against the Clippers, but still have the league’s biggest differential between their record when they’ve won the first quarter (22-5, .815) and when they’ve lost the first quarter (7-16, .304).


Myles Turner played only 36 minutes on the trip, suffering a neck injury after coming back from an ankle sprain. Thomas Bryant has filled in and the Pacers have allowed less than a point per possession in 196 total minutes with Bryant on the floor alongside Siakam.

The home team has won both meetings between the Pacers and the third-place Knicks, with the much bigger difference between the two games coming on the Pacers’ end of the floor. They’ll complete the three-game season series in Indiana on Tuesday.

Anthony Davis’ Mavs debut was terrific, but it was costly, with Davis (after tallying 26 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists and three blocks in 31 minutes) suffering an injury that will reportedly keep him out for the next few weeks.
Three takeaways

The Mavs held on to beat the Rockets after Davis’ injury and with P.J. Washington (who started at the three) also missing the second half after suffering an ankle injury. Their success with Davis on the floor was more about the offense (80 points scored on 60 possessions) than the defense, with Davis (37% from outside the paint with the Lakers) going 2-for-4 from mid-range and 2-for-2 from beyond the arc.


That’s not to say that the Mavs didn’t do some good things defensively. With Dallas blocking a franchise-record 18 shots, the Rockets shot just 23-for-59 (39%) in the paint, their worst mark this season. The Mavs rank second in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (54%) for the season.


The other guy the Mavs got from L.A. has played pretty well, too. Max Christie has averaged 17.7 points on an effective field goal percentage of 64.5% over his first three games with Dallas, also being assigned to guard some talented guys on the other end of the floor.

The Mavs’ weekend win over the Rockets was the start of a four-game homestand to close their pre-break schedule. They’ll play a couple of big games against Sacramento and Golden State this week, currently just a game in the loss column ahead of the 11th-place Warriors.

The Clippers have reshuffled their back-up backcourt, sending out Terance Mann, Bones Hyland and Kevin Porter Jr. in trades that brought back Bogdan Bogdanović and MarJon Beauchamp.
Three takeaways

The Clippers had a glut of perimeter defenders and remain in the bottom 10 offensively. So swapping Mann for Bogdanović makes sense in theory, though the latter has seen big drops in both usage rate and efficiency from last season when he finished fifth (just behind Norman Powell) in Sixth Man of the Year voting. Bogdanović’s 30.1% from 3-point range ranks 211th among 226 players with at least 100 attempts from beyond the arc. Porter (24.5%) ranks last, while Mann just doesn’t shoot that often.


The trades came during a three-game losing streak in which the Clippers scored just 108.2 points per 100 possessions against teams that rank 26th, 18th and 19th defensively. James Harden and Kawhi Leonard both shot below 40% over the three games, with Leonard also having more turnovers (10) than free throw attempts (eight). His free throw rate of 14.1 attempts per 100 shots from the field would be the lowest of his career by a healthy margin.


The Clippers broke out of their offensive slump and put an end to their losing streak against Utah’s 30th-ranked (and shorthanded) defense on Saturday. Norman Powell and Ivica Zubac led the way with 26 points each, and either would be a fine candidate to replace Anthony Davis as a Western Conference All-Star this week.

Bogdanović wasn’t available over the weekend, but the Clippers will have had three days off before completing their pre-break schedule with a home-road back-to-back. They’re 1-0 (having won a thriller in Memphis before Christmas) against the second-place Grizzlies, who they’ll host on Wednesday.

The Khris Middleton Era in Milwaukee is over, with the Bucks trading the three-time All-Star to Washington for Kyle Kuzma and to save a lot of money. They also traded their last two first round draft picks.
Three takeaways

In 758 minutes with Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard on the floor together last season, the Bucks outscored their opponents by 17.5 points per 100 possessions, the third-best on-court mark among 336 three-man combinations that played at least 500 minutes. But the trio played just 197 minutes together this season.


Kuzma arrived in Milwaukee having the worst offensive season of his eight-year career. His true shooting percentage of 48.6% ranks last among 73 players with a usage rate of 22% or higher. He shot just 9-for-26 (35%) over his first two games with the Bucks, who blew a 21-point lead in their loss in Atlanta on Friday. That ended a 96-game winning streak in games (including postseason) that they led by 20 points or more.


The Bucks did get a win over the Sixers on Sunday, improving to 3-3 in games in which they’ve had Damian Lillard without Antetokounmpo (who’s out through the All-Star break). They’ve scored more efficiently in those six games (116.4 points per 100 possessions) than they have otherwise, with the win on Sunday (in which Lillard scored a season-high 43 points) being their most efficient offensive performance of the season (135 on 104).

The Bucks have played the fewest interconference games of any team and are currently 5-7 against the West. They’ll be at a rest disadvantage when they host the Warriors on Monday, finishing their pre-break schedule with a visit to Minnesota two nights later.

The Blazers went 6-1 on the first of two seven-game homestands before hitting the road and losing in Minnesota on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Maybe the Blazers are the 2016-17 Miami Heat, who were 11-30 in their first 41 games and 30-11 in their last 41 (only to lose a tiebreaker for the final playoff spot in the East). After Game 41, Portland was 13-28 and in the bottom four on both ends of the floor. Since then, they’re 10-2, with the league’s 13th-ranked offense and its No. 1 defense by a healthy margin.


Only three of the 12 games have come against teams that rank in the top 10 offensively, but the Blazers handed Indiana’s 10th-ranked offense its worst performance in almost three months (89 points on 97 possessions) on Tuesday. And that was the second game of a back-to-back for the Blazers, who forced overtime against Phoenix the night before.


The Blazers still rank third in the percentage of their minutes coming from rookies or second-year players, but they’re playing to win. They used only eight guys in that overtime win, adding second-year forward Kris Murray to the rotation the following night.

The Blazers’ defense will be tested by the Nuggets’ fourth-ranked offense in the final two games before the break. The Blazers won the first meeting (in which both teams scored efficiently) on Anfernee Simons’ buzzer-beating drive against Russell Westbrook.

The Suns used one of those three first-round picks they got from Utah three weeks ago, but only to send Jusuf Nurkić to Charlotte. So they’re riding with the same group that has them in 10th place in the West.
Three takeaways

The Suns got a rare win without Kevin Durant on Friday. They’re now 2-11 without their All-Star, with both wins having come against the Jazz and with a miracle (two Grayson Allen 3s in the final two seconds of regulation) needed to get this latest one. Allen and Royce O’Neale (who sent their Monday game in Portland to OT) are a combined 12-for-23 on clutch 3-pointers, while Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal are a combined 9-for-44.


The win over the Jazz was the Suns’ only victory in their five February games, marking their worst stretch of defense this season (125.1 points allowed per 100 possessions). They’ve been shooting more 3-pointers, but have been outscored by an average of 23.6 points in the paint over the five games.


Bol Bol has been a bright spot, and not just for the behind-the-back dime to Damion Lee on Saturday. He totaled 31 points, 10 rebounds and seven blocks in the Suns’ weekend back-to-back, the first two times this season that he’s played more than 12 minutes.

The Suns still have a winning record (17-15) within the Western Conference, though they’re 0-3 against the top two teams, set to host the second-place Grizzlies on Tuesday. They’ll be at a rest advantage the following night in Houston for the first of three meetings with the fourth-place Rockets.

The Warriors are still in 11th place in the West and still haven’t won more than two games in a row since Nov. 15. But they now have Jimmy Butler.
Three takeaways

This would be the third straight season in which the Warriors ranked in the bottom three in free throw rate. But Butler has a rate of 60.7 attempts per 100 shots from the field over the last three seasons, the second highest rate (lower than only that of Rudy Gobert) among 213 players with at least 1,000 field goal attempts over that stretch. He was 11-for-13 from the line (and 7-for-12 from the field) in his debut in Chicago on Saturday.


That debut wasn’t looking good when the Warriors were down 24 early in the third quarter. But they somehow outscored the Bulls by 49 points (67-18) over the next 16 minutes. For the season, the Warriors have been outscored by 96 points in the other three quarters, but are a plus-90 in the third.


With Butler and Draymond Green being not-so prolific shooters from the perimeter, it may be that the Warriors stick with rookie Quinten Post (converted to a standard contract on Friday) as their starting center. Post has started the last six games, but the team has scored less than a point per possession in his 104 total minutes on the floor over that stretch.

The second half of the Warriors’ six-game trip is tougher than the first half. They’ll play a Texas back-to-back on Wednesday and Thursday, currently trailing the eighth-place Mavs by just a game in the loss column.

Considering how bad the Jimmy Butler situation was, the Heat got a solid return — Andrew Wiggins, Kyle Anderson, Davion Mitchell and the Warriors’ first-round pick (protected 1-10) — for the disgruntled star. But they had a couple of not-so-solid results on the floor last week.
Three takeaways

On Tuesday in Chicago, the Heat had a 12-point lead early in the fourth quarter, only to be outscored by 21 (37-16) over the final 10:04. On Friday in Brooklyn, they led by eight early in the fourth and were then outscored by 24 (31-7) over the final 11 minutes. Over their last four fourth quarters, the Heat have shot just 4-for-36 (11%) from 3-point range, with Tyler Herro 0-for-10.


The good news from Brooklyn was that the loss was the first time in their last nine games that the Heat didn’t commit more turnovers than their opponent. They rank in the bottom three in both turnover rate (28th) and opponent turnover rate (30th) over the last three weeks.


Anderson has averaged 3.3 deflections per 36 minutes, a rate which would rank third among Heat players who’ve played at least 500 minutes, so he could help them force more turnovers. Wiggins doesn’t get to the line nearly as much as Butler, but his 5.0 free throw attempts per 36 would be first among their current rotation guys by a healthy margin.

Those losses in Chicago in Brooklyn hurt extra because the Heat finish their pre-break schedule with three tough games. They also haven’t beaten a team that’s currently over .500 since Dec. 29. Both Wiggins and Anderson should make their Heat debuts against the Celtics on Monday.

The Pistons went 4-2 on their longest homestand of the season, winning the last two games to climb back above .500 and into sixth place in the East.
Three takeaways

The Pistons went 1-3 when Cade Cunningham missed four straight games in late November, but they got a win over the Sixers without their All-Star on Friday, taking their biggest lead of the season (34 points) early in the third quarter. It was their best offensive game (125 points on 100 possessions) since Christmas, and Malik Beasley led the way with a career-high 36 points, with 12 of those coming from the corners.


Beasley is still a ways from leading the league lead in corner 3-pointers for a second straight season, but he’s one of two players — Nickeil Alexander-Walker is the other — who’ve shot better than 50% on at least 75 attempts from the corners. Of course, Cunningham will represent the Pistons (and the worst 3-point shooter in the field) in the Starry 3-Point Contest on Saturday.


Cunningham returned on Sunday and recorded his eighth triple-double of the season in the Pistons’ win over Charlotte. Despite the victory over Philly, the Pistons have scored just 105.5 points per 100 possessions with Cunningham off the floor, so Dennis Schröder (who made his Pistons debut on Sunday) can certainly help this team in its quest to end its five-year playoff drought.

Part of the formula for making the playoffs is beating the teams that don’t. The Pistons are currently 11-4 (with six straight wins) against the bottom six teams in the East. They’re set to complete their pre-break schedule with two games in Chicago.

The Magic remain below .500, but have won two out of three games for the first time in more than a month.
Three takeaways

If they can have a decent offensive game, the Magic can win. With their victories over the Kings and Spurs last week, they’re 21-1 (with 18 straight wins) when they’ve scored at least 113 points per 100 possessions. Every other team has at least three losses when scoring at least 113 per 100.


Of course, the Magic would have two if Paolo Banchero didn’t drain a tough turnaround with 25 seconds left to beat the Spurs on Saturday. The Magic have been much better in clutch games (13-9) than they’ve been otherwise (13-19), having allowed just 92.1 points per 100 clutch possessions, the league’s best mark by a healthy margin.


While Banchero has struggled with his shot since returning from injury, Franz Wagner has averaged more points over the nine games since his return (26.8) than he did prior (24.4), while scoring nearly as efficiently (true shooting percentage of 55.5% vs. 57.3%). He was 5-for-6 from 3-point range in the win in Sacramento (more 3s than he had over a 10-game stretch late last season) and scored a game-high 33 points against the Spurs.

The Magic are 12-3 against the seven teams behind them in the Eastern Conference standings, though they’ve yet to face the Hawks, who they lead by just a half-game for eighth place. The first of four meetings is Monday in Orlando.

The Kings lost their first two games with Zach LaVine and were in a 20-point hole early against the Pelicans on Saturday. But they came all the way back to light the beam and get back to .500.
Three takeaways

The biggest swing on Saturday was a 36-10 Kings run spanning the third and fourth quarters. Malik Monk and DeMar DeRozan combined for 21 of those 36 points, but reserve Keon Ellis was the only guy on the floor for the entirety of the run, helping the Kings win the possession game with two steals and two offensive rebounds over those eight minutes. The Kings (12-21) are now tied with the Nuggets (12-19) for the most wins after trailing by double-digits.


The Kings’ new starting lineup (with Monk at point guard) had good starts to each half in Portland on Thursday, but has still been outscored by 15 points in its 49 total minutes, with the opponents shooting 15-for-33 (45%) from 3-point range.


LaVine should eventually help the Kings’ own 3-point shooting, but he’s just 4-for-20 from beyond the arc with his new team thus far. That’s, by far, his worst three-game stretch of the season.

The Kings will play the Pelicans two more times this week, but will first make an important stop in Dallas, currently trailing the eighth-place Mavs by a game and a half.

The Spurs are 1-2 on their six-game, rodeo road trip, falling to six games below .500 for the first time.
Three takeaways

All three games on the trip have been decided by a single point. The Spurs were 8-3 in clutch games through mid-December, but have lost 10 of their last 12 that were within five points in the last five minutes, scoring just 84 points on 104 clutch possessions (0.81 per) over that stretch.


The late-game offense ran through De’Aaron Fox last week, and he put the Spurs up one in Charlotte with a step-back jumper with 7.9 seconds left. But they then yielded a wide-open, weak-side corner 3 to Miles Bridges and lost when Fox’s game-winning 3 came a little too late. The Spurs are one of four teams that rank in the top 10 in both the (lowest) percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come from 3-point range and the (lowest) percentage of their opponents 3-point attempts that have come from the corners. But they also allowed some open looks from the corners early in their win in Atlanta on Wednesday.


The Spurs have the ability to have either Fox or Chris Paul running the offense for the entire game, but they played 38 minutes over their four games last week with neither on the floor. They were outscored by 14 points, scoring just 102.4 per 100 possessions, in those 38 minutes.

The Spurs are now 6-10 against the Eastern Conference, even tough they’ve been outscored by just 1.8 points per 100 possessions over those 16 games. They’ll finish their trip with games against the worst team in the league and the defending champs.

The Hawks sold high on De’Andre Hunter, seemingly set to build around young wings/forwards Dyson Daniels, Jalen Johnson and Zaccharie Risacher. It will be fascinating to see what the next steps are.
Three takeaways

The Hawks put an end to an eight-game losing streak last week and have won three of their last four, with the only loss (against San Antonio on Wednesday) coming by a single point. They played four straight clutch games, with Trae Young scoring 27 of their 40 clutch points over that stretch. The Hawks got a comfortable win in Washington on Saturday, but are still just 9-16 in games that weren’t within five points in the last five minutes.


Overall, Young has averaged 31.8 points on an effective field goal percentage of 55.4% over the Hawks’ five February games. With that, they have a top-10 offense this month, though they remain in the bottom 10 on that end of the floor for the season.


Going forward (and once Johnson is healthy) the Hawks should be able to amass some pretty good defensive lineups with Terance Mann, Daniels, Risacher and Johnson. They’ve been about average defensively (113.3 points allowed per 100 possessions) in 336 total minutes with the latter three on the floor together.

The Hawks trail the eighth-place Magic by just half a game, with the first of four head-to-head meetings set for Monday in Orlando. They’ll have a rest advantage two nights later in New York.

The stars are back, but the Sixers still aren’t winning.
Three takeaways

Weekend games in Detroit and Milwaukee were the first times in more than a month that the Sixers had Joel Embiid and Paul George in the lineup together, and the opponents were each missing their best player (Cade Cunningham and Giannis Antetokounmpo). But the Sixers lost both games, allowing the Bucks and Pistons to score 127.5 points per 100 possessions. In general, the defense has been much better with Embiid on the floor, but the Sixers have now allowed more than 120 per 100 in four of the last five games he’s played.


George, meanwhile, totaled just 35 points in his three games back from a five-game absence. He didn’t shoot poorly over the two weekend games, but he registered a usage rate of just 15.9%, fifth on the team and lower than that of Quentin Grimes (16.5%), who was playing his first two games with the Sixers. George’s season-long usage rate of 24.3% would be his lowest in the last 12 years.


Embiid did record his first triple-double of the season in the Sixers’ win over Dallas Tuesday, getting the game-winning bucket when the Mavs were left without a center in the closing minutes. But the Sixers were much better with him off the floor than they were with him on the floor last week. Usually (and even when he’s not at his best) it’s the opposite.

The Sixers are 7-1 against the four teams behind them in the Eastern Conference standings, set to finish their pre-break schedule with a back-to-back against the Raptors (0-1) and Nets (2-0).

Another deadline, another intriguing move by the Raptors, who acquired Brandon Ingram for Bruce Brown, Kelly Olynyk and the Pacers’ 2026 first-round pick. Ingram is still just 27 years old, but (assuming he extends his current contract or re-signs in the summer) he seemingly puts more emphasis on wins and losses next season.
Three takeaways

Ingram hasn’t played since Dec. 7, recovering from a bad ankle sprain. He certainly isn’t the snuggest fit on a team that ranks in the top 10 in both ball and player movement, and he’s also averaged almost as many mid-range attempts per 48 minutes (8.1) as the Raptors have as a team (8.3). But the acquisition was a talent play and a way to make use of Bruce Brown’s expiring contract. It will be fascinating to see how much Ingram gets paid to stay in Toronto.


Before we wonder how many games Ingram might play for the Raptors this season, we’re reminded that Immanuel Quickley, RJ Barrett and Scottie Barnes have still played just six games together, with Barrett having missed the last four in concussion protocol. Jakob Poeltl has also missed the last three games with a hip pointer.


After an 8-2 stretch, the Raptors have lost all four games (all against good teams) during Barrett’s absence. They’re much more of an interior team than a perimeter team, but with their loss in Oklahoma City on Friday, they’re somehow 1-2 in games in which they made at least 10 more 3-pointers than their opponent. The rest of the league is 62-2.

After their 31-point loss to the Grizzlies last week, the Raptors are just 2-7 in the second game of back-to-backs. They’ll finish their pre-break schedule with a Tuesday-Wednesday back-to-back, hosting the rested Cavs in the second game.

The Bulls are still hanging onto the last SoFi Play-In Tournament spot in the East, though they’ve won just four of their last 15 games.
Three takeaways

The Bulls have fallen back into the bottom five on defense, with their last three games having been their worst stretch on that end of the floor this season (129 points allowed per 100 possessions). The Bulls still rank sixth in defensive rebounding percentage, but in the last five days, they’ve allowed the Wolves and Warriors to total 39 offensive rebounds and 57 second-chance points.


Despite ranking sixth in defensive rebounding percentage, the Bulls have now averaged 4.9 fewer shooting opportunities than their opponents, the league’s worst discrepancy. They’ve had fewer opportunities than their opponents in 16 of their last 17 games.


Rookie Matas Buzelis will be in the dunk contest this weekend and may be in the Bulls’ starting lineup going forward. He got his first two career starts last week and has shot 65% (including 13-for-26 from 3-point range) over the last eight games, scoring in double-figures in each of the last six. His 2.2 blocks per 36 minutes rank second among rookies who have played at least 500 minutes.

The Bulls will finish their pre-break schedule with two games against the Pistons, having lost in Detroit (despite outscoring the Pistons by 27 points from 3-point range) eight days ago.

The Nets did their trade work in December, so they were quiet at the deadline, only saying goodbye to Ben Simmons with a buyout.
Three takeaways

The Nets lost to the Wizards by 17 on Wednesday, but that’s their only loss in their last five games. They continue to show improvement defensively, climbing out of the bottom five on that end of the floor by allowing just 105.2 points per 100 possessions over the 4-1 stretch. The Heat’s 86 points on 94 possessions on Friday (including just seven on their final 23) was their worst offensive performance of the season.


The defensive improvement started before the winning did, and the Nets now rank third defensively over the last three weeks. They’re in the top six in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (thanks in part to 13 blocks on Friday), opponent free throw rate and opponent turnover rate over that stretch.


Beyond availability (he played in 90 of a possible 251 games), defense was certainly the most disappointing thing about Simmons’ three seasons with the Nets, who’ve been in the bottom half of the league in points allowed per 100 possessions in each of the last five seasons. He was never able to make a big defensive impact, in part because he fouled a lot more (4.0 per 36 minutes) than he did over his four seasons with the Sixers (3.0 per 36).

This 4-1 stretch began with a win in Charlotte in which the Hornets scored just 83 points on 90 possessions. The two teams will meet again in Brooklyn on Monday.

The Jazz were the league’s best facilitator at the trade deadline, but kept their veterans, even though they won’t be using them to their full capability (or availability) over the next two months.
Three takeaways

The Jazz were 0-33 (the only winless team) in games they trailed by double-digits before Wednesday, when they came back from 11 points down against the Warriors with just three minutes left. They scored 18 points on just eight possessions, with a Walker Kessler block leading to a pretty audacious Keyonte George 3-pointer for the lead with 25 seconds left.


They played another close game two nights later in Phoenix, losing because they somehow allowed Grayson Allen to make two 3-pointers in the last two seconds of regulation. The Jazz have allowed 130.4 points per 100 possessions with the score within five points in the last five minutes, which would be the worst defensive mark in the 29 seasons for which we have clutch data.


Collin Sexton sprained his ankle last week and the starting frontline got the night off on Saturday, but Isaiah Collier has now started the last nine games at point guard, and he had three straight games of double-digit assists last week. What would seemingly be Jazz’s current, when-everybody’s-healthy starting lineup — Collier, Sexton, Lauri Markkanen, John Collins and Walker Kessler — has played just 23 total minutes together.

The Jazz’s loss to the Clippers on Saturday was the first of six straight games against the top seven in the Western Conference, with another game against the Clips (Thursday) included. The Jazz are the only team without a win (they’re 0-13) against the top seven in the West.

It was a weird week for the Hornets, who gave up a promising, 23-year-old center, but then got him back.
Three takeaways

It was surprising that the Hornets, a team of the future, were willing to trade Mark Williams, an athletic seven-footer who had averaged 20 points and 12 rebounds over his last 10 games. But that Williams couldn’t pass his physical with the Lakers goes to one reason why the Hornets were willing to deal him. At the time of the trade, he had played in just 85 (40%) of a possible 212 games over his 2 1/2 seasons in Charlotte. With LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller (out for the season) also dealing with injuries, the Hornets’ core trio will have played just 254 minutes together over two years. For context, Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Mikal Bridges have played 1,294 minutes together this season.


The big positive from the one-for-two trade being rescinded is that it left an open roster spot for plus-minus superstar Moussa Diabaté, who got a standard contract on Saturday. Of course, Diabaté (who left the Hornets’ loss in Detroit early after getting hit in the face on Sunday) might now have to compete for minutes with Jusuf Nurkić, who might not be on the roster had the Williams trade never happened.


Ball returned from a five-game absence on Friday and assisted on Miles Bridges’ game-winner as the Hornets ended a six-game losing streak with a victory over the Spurs. The Hornets still have just three wins (the fewest in the league) in games that weren’t within five points in the last five minutes.

The Hornets are 0-2 against the Nets, having lost at home by 21 less than two weeks ago. The third of four meetings is on Monday in Brooklyn.

The Pelicans have lost eight straight games, but they were able to get a first-round pick for Brandon Ingram at the deadline.
Three takeaways

Ingram and Zion Williamson were in New Orleans together for six seasons. In only two of those six seasons — 2020-21 and last season — did they play in more than 22 games together. The Pelicans reached the playoffs just twice (both times as the 8 seed) over those six years, winning two total playoff games.


Overall, the Pelicans outscored their opponents by 4.0 points per 100 possessions (good, but not great) in the duo’s 3,104 total regular season minutes together.


Ingram’s departure probably ensures that Trey Murphy III won’t ever come off the bench again. Murphy tied his career-high with 41 points in Denver on Monday and has an effective field goal percentage of 60.4% since Dec. 2 after getting off to a slow start (46.5%) in his first eight games back from his preseason hamstring injury. Even with that slow start included, his true shooting percentage of 62.2% ranks ninth among the 43 players who’ve averaged at least 20 points per game.

The Pelicans have won just one of their last 22 games against the 14 teams that currently have winning records, and they’ll complete their four-game trip in Oklahoma City on Monday.

The Wizards added to their pick trove at the deadline, dealing Kyle Kuzma and Jonas Valančiūnas, while also taking Marcus Smart off the Grizzlies’ payroll.
Three takeaways

The Wizards also got rookie AJ Johnson from the Bucks, so they now have four players selected in the first round of last year’s Draft. Alex Sarr (ankle sprain) has missed the last seven games, but rookies have already accounted for 31% of their minutes, the league’s highest rate by a huge margin.


The Wizards no longer rank last on both ends of the floor, having (barely) climbed out of the basement on defense. They allowed just 108.5 points per 100 possessions (their best three-game stretch of defense this season) over their 3-0 road trip before returning home and losing games to the Cavs and Hawks. They’ll have two head-to-head matchups with the 30th-ranked Jazz in March.


Jordan Poole scored a career-high 45 points against Cleveland, adding 21 the following night against Atlanta. He shot just 5-for-25 from 3-point range but was 15-for-20 in the paint. That takes his season-long field goal percentage in the paint over 50%, though it remains his worst mark in the paint since his rookie season.

It will be interesting to see how much Smart (who’s played just once since Christmas) and Khris Middleton play for the Wizards over the next two months. They’re both out for their game against the Spurs on Monday.

The Thunder went into the break with just their second double-digit loss of the season, but they’re still eight games up on the second-place Grizzlies at the top of the Western Conference.
Three numbers to know

They’ve outscored their opponents by 12.9 points per game, which would be the best point differential in NBA history, topping the mark of the 1971-72 Lakers (plus 12.3 per game). They remain the only team that hasn’t lost a game by at least 20 points.


They’ve committed 6.1 fewer turnovers than their opponents, which would be the best differential in the 48 seasons for which turnovers have been counted. They’d be just the second team in the 29 seasons of play-by-play data (joining the 2022-23 Toronto Raptors) to lead the league in both turnover rate (11.9 per 100 possessions) and opponent turnover rate (18.0 per 100).


Having come back from 21 points down against Miami on Wednesday, they’re 12-7 in games they trailed by double-digits, which would be the best record when down 10-plus in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data.

The Thunder are playing five of their first six post-break games on the road, and they’ll be back in Minnesota (where they lost last week) on Sunday.

The Celtics seemingly woke up at the start of February. They’ve won seven of their last eight games, with victories in Cleveland and New York.
Three numbers to know

The Celtics are the only team that ranks in the top five on both ends of the floor. They’re 39-16 with the point differential of a team that’s 43-12, with that being the league’s biggest differential between a team’s “expected” wins and its actual wins.


They already have more losses at TD Garden (17-10, .630) than they had in either of the last two seasons (32-9 and 37-4), but are 22-6 (.786) on the road. That would be the third-biggest road-home differential in NBA history.


Only 21.5% of their points, the league’s lowest rate, have come from fast breaks (10.2%, lowest) or second chances (11.3%, ninth lowest).

This spark for the Celtics seemed to be a comeback from 26 points down late in the third quarter in Philadelphia on Feb. 2. They’re back in Philadelphia on Thursday.

Three numbers to know

The Cavs have scored 8.7 more points per 100 possessions than the league average, which would be the second-best differential in 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data. Their effective field goal percentage of 58.7% would be the highest in NBA history, while their assist/turnover ratio of 2.23 would be the fourth highest in the 48 seasons that turnovers have been counted.


They’re the only team that ranks in the top five in field goal percentage in the paint (61.1%, second), mid-range field goal percentage (43.8%, fifth) and 3-point percentage (39.3%, first).


They’ve played the league’s easiest schedule regarding cumulative opponent winning percentage, but also have the best record (20-6) in games played between the 16 teams that are currently above .500.

The Cavs have three games remaining against the third-place Knicks, who they haven’t seen since October. The first is in Cleveland on Friday, when both teams will be playing the second game of a back-to-back.

Three numbers to know

The Nuggets have averaged 59.9 points in the paint per game, the most (by a healthy margin) for any team in the 29 seasons for which we have shot-location data. They lead the league in both field goal percentage in the paint (61.2%) and the percentage of their shots that have come in the paint (54.4%). They rank last in 3-point rate (34.7% of their shots) by a wide margin and for what would be the second straight season.


They have the league’s biggest differential between their record when they’ve won the first quarter (23-2, .920) and when they’ve lost the first quarter (12-17, .414). But they also have seven wins (they’re 7-14) in games they trailed by double-digits in the fourth. That’s tied for the most for any team in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data.


Nikola Jokić leads the league in on-off differential for what would be the fourth straight season, with the Nuggets having been 20.5 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (plus-12.3) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-8.2).

The Nuggets have only seven remaining games (the fewest in the league) against the 14 teams currently below .500. The first is a rest-advantage game against the Hornets on Thursday.

The Knicks kept the fourth-place Pacers at bay with a big win in Indiana on Tuesday, then got some Jalen Brunson heroics to edge the Hawks in overtime.
Three numbers to know

The Knicks’ starting lineup has played 806 minutes, 278 more than any other lineup in the league. It has outscored opponents by 5.4 points per 100 possessions, a mark which ranks ninth among 20 lineups that have played at least 200 minutes.


Brunson leads the league in time of possession (8.7 minutes per game) and clutch usage rate (46.5%), with the latter being the highest rate for any player in the last six seasons. He’s one of two players – Nikola Jokić is the other – who’ve shot better than 50% (34-for-64) on at least 50 clutch shots.


Josh Hart has a career-best effective field goal percentage of 61%, up from 49.3% last season. That’s the biggest jump by a wide margin among 85 players with at least 500 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons. Mikal Bridges (from 52.1% to 56.9%) has seen the sixth biggest jump, though he’s also seen the biggest drop in free throw rate among that group.

The Knicks are 0-5 against the top three teams in the league, set to visit two of them – the Cavs and Celtics – this weekend. Their game in Cleveland on Friday begins a stretch where they’re playing 11 of 14 on the road (where they haven’t lost since Jan. 4).

The Grizzlies are barely holding on to second place in the West, having lost two of their last three games before the break.
Three numbers to know

The Grizzlies have been 13.8 points per 100 possessions better than they were last season, which would be the biggest season-to-season jump in the 29 years for which we have play-by-play data. This wouldn’t be the best season in franchise history regarding winning percentage, but it is concerning point differential (plus-7.5 per game).


They have the league’s biggest differential between their record vs. the 14 teams currently below .500 (23-3, .885) and their record vs. the 16 teams currently above .500 (13-15, .464). The latter is the 10th best in games played between the top 16 teams.


They’ve averaged 34.2 transition points per game, most in the 21 seasons of Synergy tracking by a wide margin, with the second-highest average coming from this season’s Bulls (30.0).

After losing three of their first six games against the Eastern Conference, the Grizzlies have won 13 of their last 14. They’ll begin their post-break schedule with three visits to teams in the East’s top seven.

Luka Dončić played his first two games as a Laker last week, but they split their home-and-home series with the Jazz, seeing their six-game winning streak come to an end in Utah on Wednesday.
Three numbers to know

Statistically, the Lakers were the second most improved team between Christmas and the All-Star break, 8.7 points per 100 possessions better over that stretch (plus-5.9, fifth best) than they were through Christmas (minus-2.8, 21st).


They’ve seen the league’s biggest drop in pace, having averaged 2.8 fewer possessions per 48 minutes than they did last season.


They lead the league in free throw differential for what would be the third straight season, though this year’s differential (+2.8 points per game) is a big drop from last season (+4.6). They’re the only team that ranks in the top five in both free throw rate (27.0 attempts per 100 shots from the field, first) and opponent free throw rate (21.8 per 100, fifth).

The Lakers are one of two teams — the Spurs are the other — with a league-high eight back-to-backs left on their schedule. The first (thanks to a postponement) is their first two games out of the break, and they’ll be at a rest disadvantage in Portland on Thursday.

The Rockets were able to end their slide with a couple of wins at home, but they went into the break with an ugly loss to the Warriors.
Three numbers to know

The Rockets have averaged 5.9 more shooting opportunities per game than their opponents, the league’s biggest differential. They’ve grabbed 36.3% of available offensive rebounds, the league’s highest rate by a wide margin and the highest rate for any team in the last 21 seasons. Their 18.1 second-chance points per game would be the second most for any team in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data.


They rank last in ball movement, averaging just 293 passes per 24 minutes of possession, according to Second Spectrum tracking. They’ve seen the league’s biggest drop in assist rate, recording assists on just 54.5% of their field goals (30th), down from 59.4% (27th) last season.


The Rockets’ initial starting lineup has outscored opponents by 6.6 points per 100 possessions in its 416 minutes, but they’ve been outscored by 1.6 per 100 in 316 minutes with the other four starters on the floor without Jabari Smith Jr., who’s missed the last 22 games. The much bigger difference has been on defense (103.8 vs. 115.9 allowed per 100).

The Rockets are tied with the Wolves for the best record (12-6) in games played between the top eight teams in the Western Conference. Minnesota has won two of the three head-to-head meetings, and the final one will be Friday in Houston.

Three numbers to know

The Wolves have played 34 games that were within five points in the last five minutes, tied (with Golden State and Houston) for the league lead. They’re just 15-19 in those clutch games (four more clutch losses than they had all of last season) and 16-6 otherwise, with that being the league’s second-biggest differential. They’re 31-25 with the point differential of a team that’s 35-21.


They’re one of two teams – the Cavs are the other – that rank in the top five in both 3-point percentage (37.7%, fourth) and the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range (45.4%, fifth). Anthony Edwards leads the league with 227 3-pointers, more than he’s made in any of his previous four seasons.


They rank just 22nd in 2-point percentage, so they have the league’s biggest differential between the value of their 3-pointers (1.13 points per attempt) and the value of their 2-pointers (1.06).

The Wolves have the West’s easiest remaining schedule regarding cumulative opponent winning percentage. However, their post-break slate begins with four games against teams — the Rockets, Thunder (twice) and Lakers — ahead of them in the West standings.

The Clippers are 10-5 with Kawhi Leonard in the lineup and have outscored their opponents by 16.8 points per 100 possessions in 254 minutes with Leonard, James Harden, Norman Powell and Ivica Zubac on the floor together.


Harden (from 20.2% to 28.6%) and Powell (from 19.3% to 26.7%) have seen the biggest and fourth biggest jumps in usage rate from last season to this season among 256 players who’ve played at least 500 minutes each year. Harden’s jump has come with a big drop in efficiency, while Powell has registered his highest true shooting percentage (63.3%) of the last four seasons.

The Mavs have seen the league’s biggest drop in 3-point rate, from 44.1% of their shots (second) last season to just 39.8% (22nd) this season. They’ve seen the biggest jump in the percentage of their shots that have come in the paint.


The Mavs have allowed 8.3 fewer points per 100 possessions with Dereck Lively II on the floor (106.4) than they have with him off the floor (114.7). That’s the second biggest on-off differential on defense (smaller than only that of Pascal Siakam) among primary starters who’ve played at least 750 minutes.


Kyrie Irving leads the league in fourth-quarter scoring at 7.5 points per game, but the Mavs have seen the league’s second-biggest drop in clutch winning percentage. They’re 14-15 (20th) in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, down from 23-9 (second best) last season.

The Mavs are one of three teams with a league-low 26 games remaining on their schedule. One of the most important could be their visit to San Francisco on Sunday, with the 10th-place Warriors trailing them by just a game in the loss column.

The Warriors are 3-1 with Jimmy Butler, their best four-game stretch of defense (106.7 points allowed per 100 possessions) since their first four games after Christmas.
Three numbers to know

The Warriors are the only team in the top five of Second Spectrum’s shot quality metric on both offense (fifth highest) and defense (second lowest). But they rank 23rd in effective field goal percentage and 12th in opponent effective field goal percentage.


They’ve scored 13.4 more points per 100 possessions with Stephen Curry on the floor (116.4) than they have with him off the floor (103). That’s the third biggest on-off differential on offense (trailing only those of Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander) among 306 players who’ve played at least 500 minutes for a single team.


They have the league’s 27th-ranked offense (106.1 points scored per 100 possessions) before halftime and its sixth-ranked offense (118.4 per 100) in the second half. That’s the biggest half-to-half differential for any team on either end of the floor, and it’s not just about shooting. They also have a much higher free throw rate, a much lower turnover rate, and a much higher offensive rebounding percentage after halftime.

The 10th-place Warriors come out of the break with what might be their two most important games remaining on their schedule. They’ll visit the ninth-place Kings on Friday and then host the eighth-place Mavs two days later.

The Bucks went 3-3 as they played their final six pre-break games without Giannis Antetokounmpo, getting a win without either of their two All-Stars in Minnesota on Wednesday.
Three numbers to know

Antetokounpo has averaged 21.2 points in the paint, the most for any player in the last 25 seasons. But as a team, the Bucks rank 28th in points in the paint, both per game (43.0) and per 100 possessions (42.8). Only 56% of Bucks possessions, the league’s lowest rate, have come with a paint touch, according to Second Spectrum tracking.


They lead the league with 36 games of shooting the league average (35.9%) or better from 3-point range. They have the second biggest differential between their record in those games (26-10, .722) and their record when they’ve shot worse than average (3-14, .176).


On the other end of the floor, they’ve allowed their opponents to take only 46% of their shots, the league’s lowest opponent rate, in the paint.

The Bucks are 0-4 when playing the second game of a back-to-back on the road, having lost those four games by an average of 18.8 points. They’ll begin their post-break schedule with a home-road back-to-back, with the second game in Washington on Friday.

The Pistons have a four-game winning streak, with all four wins having come by double-digits.
Three numbers to know

The Pistons have been the league’s most-improved team regarding winning percentage and its second-most-improved team concerning point differential per 100 possessions (+9.7). They already have more than twice as many wins as they had all of last season (14-68), and they’re the only team when adjusting for the league average, that’s been at least two points per 100 possessions better on both offense (+5.5) and defense (-4.2).


They have the league’s biggest differential between their record after leading by double-digits (25-4, fifth best) and their record after trailing by double-digits (5-22, ninth worst).


Malik Beasley leads the league with 162 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, 39 more than any other player has made. Cade Cunningham ranks second with 179 assists on 3-pointers, one fewer than Trae Young.

The Pistons have nine rest-advantage games left on their schedule, with no other team having more than six. Their first is in Austin on Friday, but after that, they’ll begin their third (and final) stretch of five games in seven days.

After their 10-1 stretch, the Blazers went into the break with an 0-3 road trip, allowing 135 points per 100 possessions over their two-game series in Denver.
Three numbers to know

The Blazers are 23-32 with the point differential (-5.6 per game) of a team that’s 17-38. That’s the league’s biggest differential between a team’s actual wins and its “expected” wins. They have 15 losses, but only four wins, by at least 20 points.


Over their 10-1 stretch, the Blazers ranked first defensively (104.7 points allowed per 100 possessions), up from 28th (117.5) before that. They’re still in a position to have a bottom-10 defense for the sixth straight season.


Jerami Grant has a usage rate of 19.3%, down from 25.5% last season. That’s the third biggest drop among 256 players who have played at least 500 minutes in each of the last two seasons, and it’s come with a significant drop in efficiency.

The Blazers have two rest-advantage games left on their schedule and the first is their first game out of the break, a visit from the Lakers on Thursday. They’ve lost the last five meetings, including two in L.A. earlier this season.

The Suns lost six of their last seven games before the All-Star break, with the only win coming in overtime against the Jazz.
Three numbers to know

The Suns are 17-12 (sixth best) in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, but just 9-16 otherwise. That’s the league’s biggest such differential.


They’ve averaged 5.0 fewer shooting opportunities per game than their opponents. That’s the league’s worst discrepancy. They rank in the bottom 10 in offensive rebounding percentage (27th), defensive rebounding percentage (21st) and opponent turnover rate (28th).


This would be Kevin Durant’s 13th season of averaging at least 25 points per game with a true shooting percentage of 60% or better. That’s four more seasons than any other player in NBA history, with LeBron James (9) and Stephen Curry (8) next on the list.

The Suns begin their post-break schedule with a four-game road trip, and their visit to Chicago on Saturday is the start of their third (and final) stretch of five games in seven days. They’re just 2-9 in the second game of back-to-backs.

The Magic went 2-1 on their three-game homestand before the break, somehow losing the game (vs. Atlanta last Monday) in which they shot well from 3-point range.
Three numbers to know

The Magic were not a good 3-point shooting team last season (35.2%, 24th), but they’ve still seen the league’s biggest drop in 3-point percentage, ranking last at 30.6%. They don’t have any of the 123 players who’ve shot the league average (35.9%) or better from 3-point range. The Rockets (1) are the only other team with fewer than two.


They’re 17-10 (.630) at home and just 10-19 (.345) on the road, with that being the league’s biggest home-road winning percentage differential.


Franz Wagner is one of two players – Victor Wembanyama is the other – who have played at least 500 minutes with their team at least five points per 100 possessions better on both offense and defense with them on the floor. Overall, Orlando has been 12.3 points per 100 possessions better with Wagner on the floor (plus-5.6) than it has been with him off the floor (minus-6.7).

The Kings won the first two of their three games against the Pelicans in the last six days before the break. But they let one get away on Thursday, and they’re in a position where every game is crucial.
Three numbers to know

The Kings have a much better record under Doug Christie (15-9, .625) than they had under Mike Brown (13-18, .419). But they’ve been worse statistically, outscoring opponents by just 0.2 points per 100 possessions (14th) under Christie vs. plus-1.6 (13th) under Brown. They’re 10-3 in clutch games since the coaching change, having gone 6-13 prior.


The Kings have been outscored by 6.4 points per game from 3-point range, the league’s worst discrepancy. They’re one of three teams that rank in the bottom 10 in both 3-point percentage (25th) and 3-point rate (23rd), and they’re one of three teams that rank in the bottom 10 in both opponent 3-point percentage (29th) and opponent 3-point rate (23rd).


They lead the league in the percentage of their shots (16.3%) that have come from mid-range, a rate that’s more than double that of six other teams. DeMar DeRozan leads the league (for the fourth straight season) in mid-range shots, with his 427 being 195 more than any other player has attempted.

Three numbers to know

As they stand now, this is the Heat’s worst season in the last 10 years (since 2014-15), both regarding winning percentage and point differential per 100 possessions. They have a top-10 defense for what would be the fifth straight year but are one of only eight teams that have allowed more points per 100 possessions than they did last season.


The Heat have played the most zone defense for what would be the third straight season. They’ve allowed 0.98 points per possession in the zone, a rate that ranks sixth among 16 teams who’ve played at least 100 zone possessions, according to Synergy tracking.


They lead the league with four losses (they’re 17-4) in games they led by double-digits in the fourth quarter, more than they had in the last two seasons combined (61-3).

The Heat are tied for the league’s most home-heavy remaining schedule, with 18 of their 29 games on Biscayne Bay. But they’ll come out of the break with a three-game trip that starts in Canada on Friday.

Three numbers to know

The Spurs ranked 14th defensively (111.9 points allowed per 100 possessions) when they were 18-16 and in eighth place in the West. Over their 18 games since they rank 28th on that end of the floor (118.3 allowed per 100).


The Spurs lead the league in opponent free throw rate (19.3 attempts per 100 shots from the field). Victor Wembanyama has averaged 1.68 blocks per personal foul, the highest rate for any player with at least 100 total blocks in the 52 seasons that blocks have been counted.


Over their five games with De’Aaron Fox, the Spurs have been better in their 110 minutes with both Fox and Chris Paul on the floor (plus-5.5 points per 100 possessions) than they’ve been in 104 total minutes with one on the floor without the other (minus-2.7 per 100).

The Hawks are 3-1 since trading De’Andre Hunter and Bogdan Bogdanović at the trade deadline, with the one loss coming in overtime in New York.
Three numbers to know

The Hawks have seen the league’s fifth-biggest drop in both points scored per 100 possessions (-5.2) and points allowed per 100 possessions (-4.9). This would be the highest they’ve ranked defensively in the last eight seasons.


They’re one of four teams – the Bulls, Warriors and Pacers are the others – that rank in the top five in both ball and player movement, according to Second Spectrum tracking. They ranked last in ball movement last season, but have seen the league’s biggest jump in passes per 24 minutes of possession.


Trae Young leads the league in assists per game (11.5), assists on dunks (142), assists on 3-pointers (180) and clutch assists (29). But his turnover rate (12.9 per 100 possessions used) is the highest of his career and his true shooting percentage (56.1%) would be his lowest mark since his rookie season.

Three numbers to know

The Raptors are one of two teams — the Wizards are the other — that rank in the bottom five on both ends of the floor. This would be the lowest they’ve ranked offensively in the last 13 seasons.


They rank second in the percentage of their shots that have come in the paint (54.1%) and 29th in the percentage that have come from 3-point range (36.6%). They’re tied for the most games (36) in which they’ve been outscored from beyond the arc and are 7-29 in those games.


They’ve had Immanuel Quickley, RJ Barrett and Scottie Barnes all in the lineup for just seven of their 55 games. They’re just 1-6 in those games and have been outscored by 22.1 points per 100 possessions in their 127 minutes on the floor together.

The Sixers are one loss from being the second team to match its total from last season (47-35). They’ve seen the league’s second biggest drops in both winning percentage and point differential per 100 possessions (-6.9). When you take the league average account, the drop-off has slightly bigger on offense (-3.6) than its been on defense (+3.3).


Their most-used lineup has played just 72 minutes together, the fewest for any team’s most-used five-man unit. And it includes Caleb Martin, who’s no longer on the team.


The Sixers have been much worse offensively and much better defensively with Joel Embiid on the floor (106.1 combined points per 100 possessions with their opponents) than they’ve been with him off the floor (114.9 combined). Embiid’s effective field goal percentage of 49.3% would be the worst mark of his career and ranks 200th among 235 players with at least 250 field goal attempts.

That’s the third biggest on-off differential among 306 players who’ve played at least 500 minutes for a single team, trailing only those of Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.

The Hornets have played the league’s most home-heavy schedule (29/52) to date. They’ll begin their post-break schedule with their longest road trip of the season (six-games over just nine days), with five of the six games against teams with winning records.

The Wizards went into the break with an 0-4 homestand, though they were competitive against some good teams.
Three numbers to know

The Wizards have been outscored by 13.4 points per game, what would be the third worst point differential for any team in NBA history.


They’re in position to be the first team in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data to rank in the bottom 10 in each of the four factors on offense and in each of the four factors on defense. Only three other teams in that span – the last being the 2008-09 Clippers – ranked in the bottom 10 in seven of the eight.


They’ve gotten 45% of their minutes from rookies and second-year players, the league’s highest rate by a wide margin. Bub Carrington, Kyshawn George and Alex Sarr rank first, sixth and eighth among rookies in total minutes. The Wizards’ numbers with all three on the floor (minus-10.7 points per 100 possessions in 252 minutes) are better than their numbers otherwise.

The Wizards have the league’s second easiest post-break schedule in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage. After hosting the Bucks on Friday, they’ll play eight straight games against teams with losing records, currently 7-14 in games played within that group.

The Thunder are now an amazing 10 games in the loss column ahead of the second-place Grizzlies, who are 10 games in the loss column ahead of the 11th-place Suns.
Three takeaways

The Thunder continue to play big, starting Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein together. They haven’t been playing a ton of double-big minutes (15.3 per game over the last three), but they’ve outscored their opponents by 17.5 points per 100 possessions in 77 minutes with both of them on the floor.


The Celtics are no longer the only team that ranks in the top five on both ends of the floor. The Thunder have joined them for what would be the second straight season, having scored 125.9 points per 100 possessions (best in the league) in February. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander continues to lead the way, but Jalen Williams has been scoring more efficiently, while Aaron Wiggins (18.7 points per game) and Lu Dort have combined for a true shooting percentage of 68.4% this month.


With their win in Utah last week, the Thunder are 27-1 (with 20 straight wins) against the 15 teams currently at or below .500, with every other team having at least four losses against that group. The one loss was in San Antonio during the November stretch when the Thunder didn’t have Hartenstein or Holmgren.

The Thunder will return to the Frost Bank Center on Sunday for the third of three straight games against teams with losing records. First, they’ll complete their season series with the Wolves.

OffRtg: 119.0 (3) DefRtg: 109.6 (5) NetRtg: +9.5 (3) Pace: 97.7 (26)
The Celtics have won nine of their last 10 games, with all five wins on their current winning streak coming by at least 13 points.
Three takeaways

The Celtics were not messing around last week. They trailed in their two games for a total of just 85 seconds, and they’ve led each of their last five games by at least 24 points.


One sign that the Celtics’ offense has been more purposeful over this 9-1 stretch is that they’ve recorded assists on 67% of their field goals (the league’s eighth highest rate), up from 61% (23rd) prior. Jayson Tatum had 19 assists over their two wins last week and is registering career-high marks for assists per game (5.7), assist ratio (18.5% of his possessions) and assist/turnover ratio (2.07).


Their five-game winning streak has been the Celtics’ best five-game stretch of defense this season (104.6 points allowed per 100 possessions), and it includes two wins over the Knicks’ fourth-ranked offense. The Knicks shot well (38%) from 3-point range over the two games, but the attempts (34% of their shots) were limited and they shot just 47% in the paint.

After the Celtics visit Toronto and Detroit, they’ll have their longest homestand of the season (seven games over 13 days), which includes marquee matchups with the Cavs, Nuggets, Lakers and Thunder.

OffRtg: 122.0 (1) DefRtg: 111.2 (7) NetRtg: +10.8 (2) Pace: 100.6 (7)
There are a handful of teams playing really well right now, and the Cavs have the league’s longest active winning streak (seven games), with quality victories over the Knicks and Grizzlies over the weekend.
Three takeaways

The Cavs have seemingly turned it up defensively. Before Sunday, they had allowed 106.4 points per 100 possessions over their last 11 games, up from 112.1. Even with the Grizzlies scoring efficiently (123 on 99) over the weekend, Cleveland has climbed from 12th to seventh on defense over the last four weeks. That stretch has been pretty balanced regarding the strength of the opposing offenses.


But most of the improvement is about opponent 3-point shooting: 37.3% (26th) through their first 45 games, 32.2% (fifth) over the last 12. There’s also been some improvement in the paint, with the Nets and Knicks having combined to shoot 46-for-96 (48%) in the paint in the Cavs’ first two games out of the break.


The tie-breaker is unlikely to come into play at the top of the East, but the Cavs would surely like to even the season series when they visit the Celtics on Friday. They’ve been outscored by 36 and 18 points from 3-point range in their two losses, with their 3-point rate against the Celtics (39.4% of their shots) being their lowest vs. any opponent.

After the visit to Boston, the Cavs will play four straight games against teams with losing records. They’re 12-1 since mid-December against the 14 teams currently below .500.

The Lakers are 2-2 with Luka Dončić, who, after some early struggles, busted out with a huge performance in a big win in Denver on Saturday.
Three takeaways

Dončić’s third game as a Laker was pretty brutal. He had six turnovers (including three in the first four possessions) and shot just 5-for-18 as L.A. lost to the Hornets on Wednesday. But, after missing their win in Portland the following night, he returned over the weekend and helped the Lakers beat the team (the Nuggets) to whom they had lost 13 of their previous 14 meetings. Denver typically beats teams in the paint, but Saturday came with the Nuggets’ worst paint differential (52-30) of the season, thanks mostly to the Lakers’ ability to defend and get out in transition.


Though they dominated inside on Saturday, the Lakers have seen a huge jump in 3-point rate with Dončić on board. They’ve taken more than 45% of their shots from 3-point range in all four games he’s played, having done so in just 11 of their other 51. They’re 0-5 when they’ve taken more than half of their shots from beyond the arc.


The Lakers have still played just 13 games within the top eight teams in the West, with the other seven teams having all played at least 17. They were 3-8 within the top eight through January, with the three wins (all at home) by a total of just 18 points. But they’re 2-0 this month, with both wins coming on the road and by more than 20.

The Lakers’ win in Denver on Saturday was the start of five straight games within the top eight. Next is Dončić’s first game against the Mavs, and it will be a big week beyond that.

The Nuggets ran off nine straight wins before getting clobbered by the Lakers on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The nine straight wins all came against teams currently below .500. When the Nuggets finally ran into a good team, they lost by 23. Denver has the league’s third biggest differential between its record vs. the 15 teams currently at or below .500 (27-6, .818, fourth best) and its record vs. the 15 teams currently above .500 (10-14, .417, 11th).


The bigger difference against the good teams has been on offense: 113.9 points scored per 100 possessions over those 24 games. The loss on Saturday was the Nuggets’ worst offensive performance (100 points on 96 possessions) since mid-November and dropped them to 9-15 when they’ve scored fewer than 115 per 100. They’re 28-5 (with 18 straight wins) when they’ve scored 115 or more.


After missing the last seven games before the All-Star break, Russell Westbrook was back. But the Nuggets stuck with their initial (non-Westbrook) starting lineup. That lineup has outscored opponents by 9.5 points per 100 possessions in its 297 minutes, while the Nuggets are a plus-10.7 per 100 in 475 total minutes with Westbrook and Nikola Jokić on the floor with three of the other four starters.

The Nuggets are a league-best 10-1 in the second games of back-to-backs, with five back-to-backs left on the schedule. The next is the middle two games of the four-game trip (their last four games in Eastern Conference arenas) that begins in Indiana on Monday.

The Knicks remain winless against the three best teams in the league, now 0-7 after ugly losses in Cleveland and Boston over the weekend.
Three takeaways

Six of those seven losses have come by double-digits, and the Knicks have trailed each of the last four by at least 27 points. They’ve allowed 127.9 points per 100 possessions over the seven games, including 79 on 54 (1.46 per) over their two first quarters over the weekend.


The Knicks cut the Celtics’ 27-point lead down to four on Sunday, but they remain one of four teams — the Sixers, Jazz and Wizards are the others — without a win (they’re 0-13) after trailing by at least 15 points. They’re also one of two teams – Denver is the other – without a loss (they’re 26-0) after leading by 15 or more.


Mitchell Robinson could make his season debut this week and will help on the glass. The Knicks have seen the league’s third-biggest drop in offensive rebounding percentage and its 10th-biggest drop in defensive rebounding percentage from last season.

Even with the losses in Cleveland and Boston, the Knicks are tied (with the Celtics) for the league’s best road record (12-4) since Thanksgiving. The two losses began a stretch where they’re playing 11 of 14 on the road.

The Pacers picked up two quality wins against the Western Conference last week, keeping them in fourth place in the East.
Three takeaways

Only the Thunder (19-5) have a better record than the Pacers (16-5) since Jan. 1, with the Pacers’ bigger improvement coming on offense. They have the league’s fifth-ranked offense (118.4 points scored per 100 possessions) in 2025, up from 10th (112.7) through Dec. 31. They haven’t shot much more effectively, but have committed just 11.7 turnovers per 100 possessions (fewest in the league) over these last 21 games, down from 14.1 per 100 (ninth) prior. Their win over the Clippers on Sunday was just the third time in that stretch that the Pacers committed more turnovers than their opponent.


The Indiana offense was really clicking out of the break, scoring 125.5 points per 100 possessions against teams — the Grizzlies and Clippers — that rank in the top eight defensively. Tyrese Haliburton led the way with 51 points and 21 assists (with just two turnovers), but seven other Pacers totaled at least 20 points over the two games.


Aaron Nesmith has been back in the starting lineup for the last four games, and he scored a season-high 19 points on Sunday. Bennedict Mathurin (back in a reserve roll) still ranks fourth in total minutes over that stretch, though the defense hasn’t been good (121.8 points allowed per 100 possessions) in his 341 minutes over the last six weeks.

The Pacers are 14-7 (second best in the East) against the Western Conference, but they’ve lost eight straight games to the Nuggets, who they’ll meet for the first time (this season) on Monday.

The Grizzlies went 1-2 on a four-day road trip through the Eastern Conference, struggling to defend two of the hottest offenses in the league.
Three takeaways

Memphis now ranks 20th defensively (115.7 points allowed per 100 possessions) since Jan. 1, down from fourth (108.3) through December. They’ve allowed more than 120 points per 100 possessions 11 times in 23 games in 2025, having done so just four times in their first 34. And though they lost to the Cavs and Pacers last week, it hasn’t been a particularly taxing stretch regarding opposing offenses overall.


Some of the drop-off has been about perimeter shooting, though the Grizzlies have also seen big drops in opponent turnover rate and defensive rebounding percentage. The drop-off has been bigger in Jaren Jackson Jr.’s minutes off the floor than it’s been in his minutes on the floor, with GG Jackson continuing to have the team’s worst on-court mark by a wide margin. Of course, he played just four minutes on Sunday and got the Grizzlies the stops they needed in Cleveland.


The Grizzlies won an ugly game in Orlando on Friday, rallying from nine points down with less than five minutes left by holding the Magic to just one point on seven clutch possessions. With that, they improved to 8-2 in the second games of back-to-backs, allowing just 107.6 points per 100 possessions over those 10 games.

Having played eight of their last 11 games on the road, the Grizzlies will now have their longest homestand of the season (five games over nine days), which begins with a visit from the Suns on Tuesday.

The Rockets came out of the break with a big win over the Wolves … but then went to Utah and blew a seven-point, fourth-quarter lead, sliding back into fifth place in the West.
Three takeaways

The Rockets have been without Fred VanVleet for the last nine games but got Jabari Smith Jr. back from a 22-game absence last week. Smith came off the bench against the Wolves but played 38 minutes and shot 4-for-6 from 3-point range. He’s attempted 4.1 3s per mid-range shot this season, up from a ratio of 2.6 through his first two seasons.


Both teams were playing the second game of a back-to-back on Saturday, but the Jazz played both games at home, while the Rockets flew 1,200 miles. They’ve played a league-high 13 back-to-backs and have the league’s second-biggest differential between their record with rest (30-14) and their record in the second games of back-to-backs (5-8). The bigger difference has been on offense, where they’ve scored just 107.4 points per 100 possessions over those 13 games with no rest.


The Rockets lead the league with 36 clutch games, with 14 of their last 15 games being within five points in the last five minutes. They’ve scored only 86 points on 84 clutch possessions (1.02 per) over that stretch, but have managed to split those 14 games.

The Rockets are still in the middle of a stretch where they’re playing 13 of 17 games at home. They’re 0-2 against the Kings, who have scored 127.3 points per 100 possessions (the best mark for any team against the Rockets) over the two games. The third and final meeting is Saturday in Houston.

The Wolves went into the All-Star break tied for the best record (12-6) in games played between the top eight teams in the Western Conference. But they came out of the break with losses to the Rockets and Thunder.
Three takeaways

Both games were within five points in the last five minutes and the Wolves couldn’t close, shooting 1-for-6 on clutch shots against the Rockets and not getting the stops they needed to give themselves a chance to tie or take the lead against the Thunder. The Wolves have the West’s third-best record (16-6) in games that weren’t within five points in the last five minutes, but are now 15-21 in the clutch, having gone 21-15 last season.


The loss on Sunday was just the fifth time this season that the Thunder have allowed more than 120 points per 100 possessions. Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid didn’t shoot well from the field, but they were a combined 22-for-23 from the line. Edwards’ big jump in 3-point rate has come with a big drop in free throw rate this season, but he’s now had double-digit attempts from the line in six of his last seven games.


With the two losses, the Wolves became the third team (joining the Pelicans and Sixers) to surpass its loss total from last season (56-26). They still rank sixth defensively but have seen the league’s second-biggest jump in points allowed per 100 possessions from last season (when they had the league’s No. 1 defense by a wide margin).

The Wolves now head to Oklahoma City for the second half of their two-day, home-and-home set and the start of a four-game trip. Their game in L.A. on Thursday is the start of their second (and final) stretch of five games in seven days.

The Warriors are 5-1 with Jimmy Butler, having avenged the one loss (at Dallas) with a blowout win on Sunday afternoon.
Three takeaways

The Warriors’ first two games after the break (against the two teams directly ahead of them in the standings) may have been the two most important games left on their schedule — and they won them both by 24 points. They’ve won three straight games for the first time since Nov. 15, and a big key has been first-quarter defense. They’ve held the Rockets, Kings and Mavs to just 65 points on 80 possessions (81 per 100) over the three first quarters.


Quinten Post started two of the first three games with Butler, but the Warriors have started the last three with Moses Moody and Brandin Podziemski in the lineup and Draymond Green at the five. That lineup has been solid (outscoring the opponents by 12 points in its 39 minutes over the three games), but over the six total games with Butler, the Warriors have been better with Post on the floor alongside Butler and Green (plus-23.1 points per 100 possessions in 51 minutes) than they’ve been with Butler and Green at the four and five (plus-10.2 in 99 minutes).


The six games with Butler have, not surprisingly, come with a jump in free throw rate. More important may be that they’ve also come with a big drop in turnover rate: 12.1 per 100 possessions, down from 14 per 100 previously.

Four of the five wins with Butler have come against teams currently at or above .500. The Warriors will now play four straight games against teams with losing records, with two of those four coming against the Hornets.

The Bucks are one of two 3-0 teams (the Cavs are the other) since the All-Star break, rallying from double-digit deficits in all three games.
Three takeaways

The Bucks had just nine wins (they were 9-29) after trailing by double-digits last season. They’re now 10-18 after facing double-digit deficits this season, even though they’ve still been better (especially offensively) before halftime (plus-4.6 points per 100 possessions) than they’ve been after halftime (minus-2.0).


Kyle Kuzma still isn’t shooting particularly well (effective field goal percentage of 47.8% in seven games with the Bucks), but he’s been on the floor down the stretch, with all four of the Bucks’ games during their current winning streak having been within five points in the last five minutes. Brook Lopez has nine blocks over the four games, with four of the nine coming on clutch possessions. One of those came against Khris Middleton (with the Bucks up three in the final minute) in his Wizards debut.


The Bucks have played the league’s easiest schedule to date regarding cumulative opponent winning percentage, with only 20 of their 56 games (three fewer than any other team) having come against the 15 teams that are currently over .500. They’re just 7-13 (only the Pistons have been worse) within that group so far, though they’ve beat the Wolves and Clippers on this four-game winning streak.

Three takeaways

Their loss to the Pacers was the Clippers’ second-worst defensive game of the season (129 points allowed on 101 possessions). With a worse-than-average offense, they need to get stops to win and are now 6-20 when they’ve allowed at least 111 points per 100 possessions.


The Clippers rank in the top 10 in three of the four factors on defense. The exception is opponent free throw rate, and Milwaukee and Indiana combined to shoot 48-for-54 (89%) from the line in their two losses last week. The opponent rate has been ridiculously low (16.9 attempts per 100 shots from the field) in Leonard’s 422 minutes on the floor.


Norman Powell has also missed the first two post-break games, dealing with a sore left knee. The Clippers have lost the last six games that Powell has missed and have scored just 106 points per 100 possessions in 638 total minutes with James Harden on the floor without him.

After the Clippers finish the Eastern Conference portion of a stretch of eight straight road games, they’ll play their first two games in their old home. They’ve split their first two meetings with the Lakers, who they now trail by four games in the loss column.

The Mavs have been killed on the glass (ranking in the bottom four in both offensive and defensive rebounding percentage) over their five games since Anthony Davis’ injury (in his debut). Second-chance points over that stretch have been 109-48 in favor of their opponents.


But they’ve outscored their opponents by 69 points from 3-point range over the five games, winning three straight before losing to the Warriors on Sunday. Their win on Friday, in which Kyrie Irving (5-for-12) and Klay Thompson (4-for-7) outscored the Pelicans (8-for-27) from deep by themselves, was the third time this season that the Mavs have taken more than half of their shots from 3-point range.


The Mavs will now face Luka Dončić for the first time, and it will be fascinating to see who gets the defensive assignment. Without any centers, they’ve been switching more. According to Second Spectrum tracking, the Mavs have switched 43% of ball screens over their last five games, up from 28% before that.

Three takeaways

The Pistons have had the league’s third-ranked offense (125.2 points scored per 100 possessions) over the winning streak. Cade Cunningham (26.2 points and 10.0 assists) continues to be the star, but Malik Beasley has also averaged 21.8 points in just 26.5 minutes off the bench over the six games.


The first five games of the winning streak were also the Pistons’ best five-game stretch of defense (104.2 points allowed per 100 possessions) this season. Then they played a 148-143 thriller in Atlanta on Sunday, the second fastest-paced game in the league this season. Detroit lost two double-digit leads and trailed by one with less than 40 seconds left, but Dennis Schröder came through with a big three-point play to put the Pistons ahead for good. That ended a four-game losing streak in games that were within five points in the last five minutes.


The Pistons are now 10 points per 100 possessions better than they were last season. Detroit and Memphis (+13.2) would be just the sixth and seventh teams in the last 25 years to see a season-to-season improvement of at least 10 points per 100 possessions. J.B.

Three takeaways

The Magic didn’t shoot particularly effectively last week and Paolo Banchero was just 21-for-58 (36%) from the field over their three games. But they continue to lead the league in free throw rate and outscored each of their three opponents from the line, with Banchero going 29-for-38 over the three games.


The Magic are out of the break with a new starting lineup, with Cole Anthony still starting at point guard (Jalen Suggs has now missed 22 of the last 23 games) and Wendell Carter Jr. rejoining Banchero and Franz Wagner up front. The new lineup outscored their opponents by 32 points (allowing just 92 on 104 defensive possessions) in its 49 minutes, though it was also on the floor down the stretch against Memphis on Friday when the Magic blew a nine-point lead with less than five minutes to go.


They were much more clutch the previous night in Atlanta, with Anthony and Banchero draining 3s on the 9-0 run that decided the game with less than three minutes left. The Magic trailed that game by 19 points early in the second quarter and (though they erased that deficit by halftime) continue to be much better in the second halves of games (plus-4.6 points per 100 possessions, seventh best) than they’ve been in first halves (minus-6.1, 26th). That’s the league’s third-biggest half-to-half differential and it’s been bigger on the defensive end of the floor.

After losing four straight games to good teams, the Blazers beat the Hornets by 53 points, the largest margin of victory in franchise history.
Three takeaways

It was a good couple of games for the Blazers’ two 24-year-old, two-way forwards. Deni Avdija and Toumani Camara combined for 82 points on 29-for-41 (71%) shooting over the two games, adding nine steals and two blocks. Camara didn’t draw any charges but continues to lead the league (by a wide margin) with 24 for the season.


Avdija hasn’t shot as effectively as he did with the Wizards last season, but he’s seen a big jump in free throw rate, from 34 to 43.2 attempts per 100 shots from the field. The 43.2 per 100 ranks eighth among 240 players with at least 250 field goal attempts this season.


As the Blazers have gone 11-5 over the last 36 days, eight of those 11 wins have come against the Eastern Conference. They have also played the fewest games (they’re 10-5) against the East, with none of those 15 games coming against the East’s top four teams.

The Heat are 1-1 on their three-game trip coming out of the break. They blew double-digit leads in both games but escaped Toronto with an overtime win.
Three takeaways

Kel’el Ware has now started the last 14 games, and the Miami defense has generally been excellent (103.7 points allowed per 100 possessions) in his 242 total minutes alongside Bam Adebayo. They added more defense (Davion Mitchell at the point) to the starting lineup last week, but the new group had more success on offense than defense in the first two games out of the break.


Ware has even been on the floor for most of the Heat’s clutch time over those 14 games in which he’s started, though the clutch offense has been almost entirely about Tyler Herro and Adebayo, who’ve combined to attempt 43 of the team’s 67 clutch shots over that stretch. Herro ranks just 31st in clutch usage rate (30.3%), but he leads the league with 19 shots (he’s 5-for-19) to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime.


Nikola Jović has played more minutes (off the bench) than Ware over these last four games but fractured his right hand in the Heat’s loss in Milwaukee on Sunday. Jović had been evolving into a solid, secondary playmaker, ranking second on the team in total assists since Jan. 1.

The eighth-place Heat are tied in the win column with the ninth-place Hawks, who they’ll visit on Monday. That will be the end of a stretch where the Heat will have played 17 of 23 games on the road. They’ll then play 14 of 17 at home (where they’ve lost six of their last eight), starting with another game against the Hawks.

The Kings were the only team with just one game last week. It was a big one, and they got clobbered by the Warriors, who passed the Kings for ninth place in the West.
Three takeaways

Their first game after the break was the Kings’ second-worst defensive game of the season, with Golden State scoring 132 points on 97 possessions. Bench minutes were an issue on Friday (the game got away with a 27-8 Warriors run spanning the first and second quarters), but the Kings’ new starting lineup has now allowed 124.1 points per 100 possessions, the worst mark among 69 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes.


Overall, the Kings rank 25th defensively since their coaching change (they were 16th under Mike Brown). The schedule has been slightly tougher regarding opposing offenses since Doug Christie took over.


The Kings have committed more turnovers than their opponents in 11 of their last 13 games, with their differential on Friday (24-12) being their worst of the season. Both Domantas Sabonis (from 2.16 before 1.63 over the last eight games) and Malik Monk (from 2.90 to 1.63) have seen big drops in assist/turnover ratio since De’Aaron Fox’s departure.

Their schedule will get much tougher starting Saturday, so the Kings need to take care of business against the Hornets and Jazz in their next two games. They’re 18-10 against the 14 teams currently below .500, 3-0 against Utah and they have yet to play Charlotte.

Victor Wembanyama is out for the rest of the season and the Spurs appear to be Lottery-bound for the sixth straight season.
Three takeaways

Before the All-Star break, the Spurs had allowed 5.4 fewer points per 100 possessions with Wembanyama on the floor (110.0) than they had with him off the floor (115.4). That’s not quite as big as his on-off differential on defense last season (6.1 per 100), but still big for a full-time starter who’s mostly defending against other starters.


Even with Wembanyama playing 46 of their 52 games, the Spurs ranked 19th defensively at the break. Without him for the final 30, they may have a bottom-10 defense for a third straight season after ranking in the bottom 10 on either end of the floor just once in the 25 seasons prior.


They’ve moved up a spot for now, having held the Suns and Pelicans under 110 points per 100 possessions last week. Of course, the defense fell apart (74 points allowed on 53 possessions) in the second half on Sunday, as the Spurs blew a 17-point lead in New Orleans. They continue to have the most losses (they’re 38-32) after leading by double-digits over the last two seasons.

The Spurs will have another game in New Orleans and then face three of the best teams in the West. They have wins over six of the top seven teams in the conference, with the exception being the Grizzlies (who they’ll visit on Saturday).

The Suns don’t appear primed to make a run up the Western Conference standings, having lost two of their first three games out of the break.
Three takeaways

After the Suns suffered their first wire-to-wire defeat of the season (Thursday in San Antonio), Bradley Beal was back in the starting lineup (replacing Tyus Jones) for their two games over the weekend. Though the Suns were trailing when they made their first sub in both games, the lineup ultimately outscored the Bulls and Raptors by 13 points (allowing just 67 on 74 defensive possessions) in its 33 total minutes.


But splitting games against the Bulls and Raptors (after losing to the Wembanyama-less Spurs) won’t get it done. The Suns have now slipped to 26th in points allowed per 100 possessions, with Mike Budenholzer never having had a bottom-five defense (only one of his teams has been worse than average on that end of the floor) in his 10 previous seasons as a coach.


They’re a jump-shooting team (28th in the percentage of their shots that have come in the paint), but the Suns are one of two teams (the Lakers are the other) that rank in the top 10 in both free throw rate (eighth) and free throw percentage (third). They’re 17-10 when they’ve outscored their opponent from the line after going 25-for-28 in their win in Chicago on Saturday.

Two games in New Orleans this week will be the end of the Suns’ final stretch of five games in seven days, but also the end of the easy portion of their post-break schedule. Starting with a visit from the Wolves on Sunday, 17 of their next 20 games will be against teams with winning records.

The Hawks have lost three straight games, slipping back to ninth place in the East.
Three takeaways

This was a different Hawks team for most of the season, better defensively and worse offensively than they’ve been over the last few seasons. But we’ve seen some reversion in the last few weeks, with the losing streak including a 149-148 loss in New York and a 148-143 loss to the Pistons (the second fastest-paced game in the league this season) on Sunday. Over their last 10 games, the Hawks and their opponents have combined to score 118.7 points per 100 possessions, up from 111.3 prior to that.


One big piece of the offensive improvement has Zaccharie Risacher, who has averaged 15.8 points on an effective field goal percentage of 65% (including 23-for-44 from 3-point range) over the last 10 games. He’s still not creating a lot of offense for himself (50 of his 57 buckets over this stretch have been assisted), but these last few weeks (including an incredible finish against the Pistons on Sunday) have been pretty promising.


Of course, the rookie has yet to fully earn Quin Snyder’s trust, playing down the stretch in only four of Atlanta’s eight clutch games this month. Trae Young has taken 36 of the Hawks’ 61 clutch shots in February.

The ninth-place Hawks are tied in the win column with the eighth-place Heat. They’ll play a home-and-home set on Monday and Wednesday, with Atlanta having won the first meeting behind big games from Jalen Johnson and De’Andre Hunter.

The Nets were competitive with the Cavs for 36 minutes and then beat the Sixers to move into 11th place in the East.
Two takeaways

The Nets ultimately lost by 13 in Cleveland, but it was just the sixth time this season that the Cavs’ No. 1 offense has been held under 110 points per 100 possessions. The Nets now rank second defensively over the last five weeks and have held their opponents to just 94.4 points per 100 possessions in Day’Ron Sharpe’s 222 minutes over that stretch.


The Nets have outscored their opponents by just 3.9 points per game over their 7-2 stretch, with their last three wins having come by a total of just 14 points. For the season, they’re 21-35 with the point differential of a team that’s 16-40, with that being the biggest differential between a team’s actual wins and its “expected” wins.

Their win in Philadelphia was the start of a stretch where the Nets are playing 10 of 16 games on the road. They’ve lost their one meeting (earlier this month) with the Wizards, who they’ll visit (with a rest advantage) on Monday.

The Raptors remain a tough out. They took the Heat to overtime on Friday and then beat the Suns two nights later.
Two takeaways

The Raptors have been much more of a paint team than a perimeter team all season. Before Sunday, they were 0-13 when they were outscored by more than four points in the paint, though they almost beat the Heat when being outscored by 18 points on the inside. Then they went 7-for-7 from 3-point range on the 22-6 run that put the Suns away on Sunday, winning a game in which they were a minus-20 (58-38) in the paint.


They’re still tied for the league lead in the number of games (36) in which they’ve been outscored from 3-point range, but the Raptors were a plus from beyond the arc in both of their games last week, with their differential against the Suns (+39) being their biggest of the season. Having Immanuel Quickley (who’s played in nine of the last 10 games) certainly helps their 3-point volume, and the point guard was 10-for-18 from deep over the weekend.

The Raptors have yet to outscore their opponent from 3-point range in three straight games and … well, they play the Celtics next. After they host Boston on Tuesday, they’ll play 15 of their final 24 games on the road. But after they visit the Pacers the following night, 20 of their final 23 will come against teams that currently have losing records.

The Sixers have lost seven straight games, becoming the second team to surpass its loss total from last season (47-35) along the way. They got blown out by the Celtics and beat at the buzzer by the Nets last week.
Two takeaways

The question for the Sixers right now is less about wins and losses (competing for the final SoFi Play-In Tournament spot in the East) and more about whether Joel Embiid should be playing if the goal is to maximize the possibility of him being available and effective next season. For most of his 31 minutes on Saturday, he seemed unable to attack mismatches on offense or protect the rim on defense. Since his return three weeks ago and with him playing in six of their last eight games, the Sixers have been better both offensively and defensively with Embiid off the floor (plus-0.6 points per 100 possessions) than they’ve been with him on the floor (minus-15.9 per 100).


With or without Embiid, Tyrese Maxey continues to shoulder a huge load offensively. Paul George has averaged just 11.9 points (in 33.3 minutes) over his return from a five-game absence (which coincides with the losing streak) and Sixers not named Maxey have shot just 28% from 3-point range over the seven games.

With the loss on Saturday, the Sixers are now in 12th place, though they’re still just a game and a half behind the Bulls for the final Play-In spot. They have two games (both at home) remaining against Chicago and (currently 2-0 in the season series) would hold the tie-breaker by winning one of them. The first of the two is Monday.

The Jazz played spoiler on Saturday, coming back from seven points down early in the fourth quarter to beat the Rockets.
Two takeaways

The All-Star break seems to have helped Keyonte George, who totaled 50 points on 17-for-29 shooting over the Jazz’s two games last week. More important may be that George (who’s been coming off the bench for the last 14 games) had 12 assists with only three turnovers. The Jazz committed nine more turnovers than the Thunder on Friday, but that was an improvement over the first two meetings (21 and 16 more).


Lauri Markkanen didn’t come out of the break so hot, shooting 2-for-14 against Oklahoma City (with Lu Dort as his primary defender). Markkanen’s effective field goal percentage (52.3%) and true shooting percentage (57.4%) would be his worst marks in the last five seasons. He’s seen the 13th biggest drop in 3-point percentage (from 39.9% to 34.7%) among 110 players with at least 200 attempts in each of the last two seasons.

The Jazz’s seven-game homestand gets a little easier this week, and last place in the West could be on the line against the Pelicans on Sunday. The Jazz were swept in a two-game set in New Orleans last month, playing both games without Markkanen and John Collins.

The Bulls were competitive against the Knicks and Suns last week, but they’ve now lost six straight games … and still hold the last SoFi Play-In Tournament spot in the East.
Two takeaways

The Bulls erased an 11-point deficit against Phoenix on Saturday, only for Julian Phillips to put Kevin Durant on the line twice in a row when Durant wasn’t in scoring position either time. The first foul came when Durant was setting a screen and the second came 90 feet from the basket. The Bulls were outscored by eight points at the line in a four-point loss and rank 26th in free throw differential (minus-1.8 points per game) for the season.


Rookie Matas Buzelis has been in the starting lineup for the last six games, but the starters have not been great during that stretch. Their two starting groups have been outscored by 57 points (scoring just 93.4 per 100 possessions) in 79 total minutes over the losing streak.

The Pelicans remain in last place in the West, though they picked up a win over the Spurs on Sunday.
Two takeaways

Zion Williamson has played in 10 of the Pelicans’ last 12 games, averaging 27.1 points (35.6 per 36 minutes) on 62% shooting over that stretch. Williamson’s usage rate (33.4%) is the highest of his career by a wide margin, though his true shooting percentage of 58.9% would be the worst mark in his five seasons.


The Pelicans’ defense has also been much better with Williamson on the floor (113.5 points allowed per 100 possessions) over these last 12 games than it has been otherwise. Their loss in Dallas on Friday completed a stretch of nine straight games against teams that currently rank in the top 10 offensively, and they have only four games against that group going forward.

The Pels will complete their two-game series with the Spurs on Tuesday and then head to Phoenix for another two-game series. Their first meeting with the Suns was Brandon Ingram’s penultimate game with the Pelicans, and he scored a game-high 29 points in a 126-124 win.

The Hornets came out of the break with a nice road win over the Lakers, but also lost by 53 points in Portland.
Two takeaways

Mark Williams returned to the Hornets’ lineup in the win over the Lakers, but he and LaMelo Ball sat out the second game of their Thursday-Friday back-to-back (a loss in Denver). The Hornets are the new Blazers, with three playable centers, and we’ve only seen a few minutes of two of them — Williams and Moussa Diabaté — on the floor together. Over the four games that Jusuf Nurkić has played, the Blazers have been at their best with the 30-year-old on the floor.


The win over the Lakers was just the 13th time this season that a team won a game while scoring less than a point per possession. The Hornets have scored less than a point per possession in four of their last five games, their worst stretch of offense this season. Hornets not named Miles Bridges have shot 37-for-141 (26.2%) from 3-point range over the five games.

The Hornets will complete their six-game trip this week, returning home to host the Wizards on Saturday. They’re 0-3 against Washington, having trailed the last two meetings by more than 20 points.

The Wizards’ latest losing streak is at six games, with their loss in Orlando on Sunday being their 20th by at least 20 points. (The record is 26.)
Two takeaways

Both Khris Middleton and Marcus Smart made their Washington debuts on Friday. Their minutes were limited, though Middleton was on the floor (and hit a big 3) as the Wizards cut a 15-point, fourth-quarter deficit down to one with a minute left. Alas, with his team back down three, Middleton drove to the hoop and was rejected by Brook Lopez. Only the Thunder (17) have played fewer clutch games than the Wizards (18), who’ve lost eight of their last nine that were within five points in the last five minutes.


Alex Sarr scored a career-high 22 points (in only 26 minutes) in the loss to Milwaukee, adding seven rebounds, two steals and a block. His lingering ankle issue kept him out of the Wizards’ game in Orland on Sunday, but Sarr is the only rookie who’s started every game he’s played in, and he’s one of six rookies who rank in the top 24 in blocks per 36 minutes.

The Wizards will have a hard time climbing out of the basement in offensive efficiency, but half of their remaining 26 games are against teams that rank in the bottom 10 defensively, while only three are against top-10 defenses.

The Cavs have been better against the Celtics (especially defensively) with Mitchell off the floor, and bench minutes were huge as they came back from an early, 22-point deficit on Friday. They’ve had the league’s top-ranked bench by a wide margin since the trade deadline and have outscored their opponents by 15.7 points per 100 possessions in De’Andre Hunter’s 208 minutes on the floor.


It’s certainly helped that Hunter is now 25-for-42 (60%) from 3-point range over his eight games with the Cavs. That includes two clutch 3-pointers against Portland on Sunday, with Hunter putting the Cavs ahead for good with a weak-side 3 off a great roll-and-kick feed from Jarrett Allen with 30.8 seconds left in overtime. That win improved the Cavs to 4-0 without Mitchell, who got the day off.

The win over Portland was a brief stop at home, and the Cavs’ schedule will remain road-heavy for the next few weeks. They currently have what would be the fifth-best road record (22-6, .786) in NBA history.

The Thunder suffered a brutal collapse (blowing a 24-point, fourth-quarter lead) against the Wolves last Monday, but recovered to go 3-0 on their ensuing road trip.
Three takeaways

The Thunder scored just seven points on 14 clutch possessions in that loss to Minnesota, but their offense has otherwise been on fire, leading the league in efficiency (127.9 points scored per 100 possessions) since the All-Star break. Jalen Williams scored a career-high 41 points in their win in San Antonio on Sunday and may have rediscovered his 3-point stroke. He’s 18-for-41 (44%) from beyond the arc since the break, up from 34% prior.


Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein were both in the starting lineup in their first seven games together, and the Thunder have outscored their opponents by 8.5 points per 100 possessions in 97 minutes with both bigs on the floor. But there was a little bit of clunkiness (Holmgren trying to throw lob passes) on offense and Hartenstein came off the bench in Atlanta on Friday. Holmgren then turned his ankle and missed the win in San Antonio.


The collapse against Minnesota came at the end of a three-game stretch where the Thunder faced a ton of zone defense. According to Synergy tracking, they’ve faced the most zone this season (6.1% of their offensive possessions) and rank fourth in zone efficiency (1.12 points per possession) among the 27 teams that have faced at least 100 total possessions of zone.

The Thunder are 6-2 in games played between the top five teams in the West, set to face the Rockets (2-1), Grizzlies (2-0) and Nuggets (1-1) this week. They have just one rest-disadvantage game remaining on their schedule, and it’s Monday in Houston.

The Celtics lost two straight games for the first time since Christmas, matching their loss total from last season (64-18) when they blew an early, 22-point lead to the Cavs on Friday. But they held off a similar Nuggets comeback on Sunday to remain two games in the loss column ahead of the Knicks for second place in the East.
Three takeaways

In their first loss to the Cavs (in Cleveland on Dec. 1), the Celtics were without Derrick White and Jaylen Brown. On Friday, they were without Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis, and they’ve had all five of their preferred starters for just 20 of their 61 games. The regular lineup has been outscored by 1.6 points per 100 possessions in its 307 minutes, but when starters aren’t available, one of the league’s best benches is thinner. In the seven-point loss on Friday (when Sam Hauser and Al Horford started), the Celtics were outscored by 33 points in 28.4 minutes with at least one reserve on the floor.


Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum can certainly beat defenders one-on-one, and the Celtics have had some efficient offensive games with low assist rates. But their offense is seemingly at its best when their stars create advantages, ball movement and open shots off the catch. Their losses to the Pistons and Cavs last week were the fifth and sixth times this season that they had fewer than 40 potential assists, with their 25 potential assists against Cleveland being a season low by a wide margin. (The Pistons and Magic are responsible for four of those six games, in which the Celtics are 3-3.)


The Celtics only outscored the Nuggets (last in 3-point rate by a wide margin) by six points from beyond the arc on Sunday. But they were also a plus-13 at the free throw line against one of the five teams ahead of them in free throw differential for the season. The Celtics have seen a small drop in free throw rate from last season, but Brown is registering his highest rate (29 attempts per 100 shots from the field) in the last seven years and was 8-for-9 from the line against Denver.

The Celtics are just two (eventful) games into their seven-game homestand, with another marquee matchup on Saturday, when the Lakers make their only visit to TD Garden. The first meeting (in January in L.A.) came with the Celtics’ worst margin of defeat (21 points) this season.

After losing their first game out of the All-Star break, the Lakers have won six straight, improving to 6-2 with Luka Dončić in uniform.
Three takeaways

The Lakers’ Friday win over the Clippers was just their sixth (they’re 6-17) in a game they trailed by double-digits and just the second of those six comeback wins coming since mid-November. But they haven’t had to worry much about falling into deep holes lately because they’ve been dominant out of the gates. Over their last 19 games, the Lakers have outscored their opponents by an amazing 34.3 points per 100 possessions in the first quarter, ranking second in first-quarter offense and first in first-quarter defense (by a huge margin) over that stretch.


The defense has also been strong late in games. Five of the Lakers’ six games during this winning streak have been within five points in the last five minutes, and they’ve allowed just four points on 18 clutch defensive possessions over that stretch. That includes keeping the Clippers scoreless (0-for-8 from the field with five turnovers) on nine clutch possessions over the weekend, with the highlight being LeBron James’ chase-down block (initially called a goaltend) on Kris Dunn.


With Rui Hachimura out, Dorian Finney-Smith started the two games against the Clippers. The start wasn’t great on Friday, but since he arrived from Brooklyn, the Lakers have been 14.5 points per 100 possessions better with Finney-Smith on the floor (plus-13.9) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-0.6). That gives him two of the top five on-off differentials among players who’ve logged at least 500 minutes with a single team.

Since getting clobbered in Cleveland and Boston, the Knicks have won three straight games, picking up comeback road wins in Memphis and Miami over the weekend.
Three takeaways

The Knicks rank 24th offensively (108.5 points scored per 100 possessions) since the All-Star break, having seen pretty big drops in free throw rate and offensive rebounding percentage. The offense has been a little better (113.0 scored per 100) over this three-game winning streak, but it might be a good thing that all three wins were somewhat ugly and that they had to get serious defensively, especially in the second half in Miami on Sunday.


They’ve still played the third fewest clutch games, but the Knicks are now 16-7 (second best) in games that were within five points in the last five minutes. That includes a 5-0 mark in overtime after some more Jalen Brunson heroics in Miami. Despite the lack of clutch games, Brunson (who’s played in all 23) ranks second in total clutch points (132) and is now 8-for-11 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime. Those eight buckets lead the league, with three players tied for second with six each.


Mitchell Robinson made his season debut on Friday, playing 26 total minutes on the Knicks’ two-game trip. All of that was in relief of Karl-Anthony Towns, so the two bigs weren’t on the floor together. Robinson had a nice block on a Tyler Herro drive on Sunday, but the Knicks’ defensive rebounding wasn’t great in those 26 minutes.

The Knicks are home for just one game between road trips, though they will have a rest advantage against the Warriors on Tuesday. That’s the first of two meetings in 12 days, with their visit to San Francisco coming at the end of a five-game trip that begins with a back-to-back in L.A.

The Nuggets went 2-2 on the four-game trip where they played four of the top six teams in the Eastern Conference, slipping to third place in the West.
Three takeaways

The Nuggets have alternated wins and losses since the All-Star break, with the difference being almost entirely about the offensive end of the floor. They’ve scored 125.2 points per 100 possessions in the three wins and just 105.4 per 100 in the three losses. Nikola Jokić has scored more efficiently in the losses, but Michael Porter Jr. has an effective field goal percentage of 58.3% in three wins and just 34.4% in the three defeats.


Turnovers have also been an issue, with the Nuggets committing 16.6 per 100 possessions (sixth most) since the break, up from just 13.9 (11th fewest) prior. Jokić had 22 turnovers over a four-game stretch before their loss in Boston on Sunday.


With their win in Detroit on Friday, the Nuggets are 11-1 in the second games of back-to-backs. That would be the fourth best no-rest record in NBA history, and their point differential in those games (plus-15.0 per game) would be the best mark ever. Jokić didn’t play in the one loss (Jan. 15 vs. Houston).

The Nuggets split two early-season games against the Thunder, with Peyton Watson (who has missed the last 13 games) sealing their Nov. 6 win by blocking Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the closing seconds. They’ll complete the season series with a back-to-back in Oklahoma City, starting with a matinee on Sunday.

The Pacers dropped a few games last week and are back in fifth place in the East, with the similarly 34-25 and fourth-place Bucks holding the head-to-head tie-breaker.
Three takeaways

The Pacers have a top-five offense since Jan. 1, but still need to get some stops to win. With their losses to the Nuggets and Heat last week, they’re 4-15 when they’ve allowed at least 120 points per 100 possessions. They somehow lost to Miami while shooting 21-for-39 (54%) from 3-point range and committing just 10 turnovers.


They still rank as the league’s sixth most improved defensive team, allowing 3.5 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did in 2023-24. Their defensive numbers have been especially great (103.7 allowed per 100) in 698 minutes with Andrew Nembhard, Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner on the floor together.


Bench minutes haven’t been so great, an issue exacerbated by the absence of Bennedict Mathurin (left wrist sprain) for the last two games. Since the All-Star break, the Pacers have been 46.6 points per 100 possessions better with Turner on the floor (plus-23.9) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-22.7).

The Pacers will host the Rockets on Tuesday, having been held to just a point per possession when they lost in Houston (without Nembhard or Aaron Nesmith) before Thanksgiving. They’ll then play six of their next seven games on the road, a stretch that includes two huge games against the Bucks.

The Grizzlies have lost five of their last seven games and are in danger of sliding out of the top four in the West.
Three takeaways

Each of the Grizzlies’ last five games have been within five points in the last five minutes, with the last three all coming down to the final possession. The Grizzlies rank third in clutch defense (101.1 points allowed per 100 possessions), but couldn’t get the stops they needed to close out the Knicks and Spurs over the weekend. They have the league’s third biggest differential between their record in games that weren’t within five in the last five (25-8, fourth best) and their record in games that were (13-14, 19th).


Brandon Clarke has shot just 3-for-8 on clutch shots and has nine fouls in less than 35 clutch minutes. But he also has five steals and three blocks in that time, and he made an incredible play (a reverse tip-in) to put the Grizzlies ahead in the final minute of overtime against Phoenix on Tuesday. With Clarke out (having been elbowed in the mouth) for the ends of the two weekend losses, Zach Edey was on the floor down the stretch and opponents took advantage. In drop coverage, Edey allowed a big Jalen Brunson 3-pointer on Friday, and after switching, he fouled De’Aaron Fox on a last-minute 3-point attempt the following night.


Ja Morant sat out the loss to San Antonio on Saturday, when the Grizzlies fell to 14-9 without their point guard. Morant is just 4-for-32 (worst among 179 players with at least 15 attempts) from 3-point range since the All-Star break and is now registering the worst effective field goal percentage (47.8%) of his career.

The Grizzlies have a tougher remaining schedule (cumulative opponent winning percentage of .524) than the fifth-place Rockets (.499), though the tougher half is late March and April. They’ll play seven of their next 12 games against teams that enter Week 20 with losing records, currently 25-4 (third best) against that group.

The Rockets are healthy again, though their latest starting lineup (with Fred VanVleet back from an 11-game absence) got off to a rough start against the Kings on Saturday.
Three takeaways

VanVleet’s return put Jabari Smith Jr. back on the bench, with Amen Thompson remaining in the starting lineup. The Rockets were down 21-9 when they made their first sub on Saturday and the Thompson lineup has now been outscored by 8.4 points per 100 possessions, the third worst mark among 20 lineups that have played at least 200 minutes together.


VanVleet’s absence hurt when it comes to the possession battle. The Rockets have averaged 3.0 fewer turnovers per 100 possessions than their opponents with VanVleet on the floor, but have averaged 2.3 more per 100 with him off the floor. They’ve still committed fewer total turnovers than their opponents for the season, but have had fewer in only three of their last 15 games.


The Rockets ranked just 23rd offensively (110.3 points scored per 100 possessions) over VanVleet’s absence. They still (barely) have a better-than-average offense for what would be the first time in the last five seasons.

The Rockets have lost six straight games on the road and now head out on a three-game trip. They’ll have a rest advantage on Monday for the fourth of five meetings with the Thunder.

The Wolves got a miraculous (and huge) win in Oklahoma City last week, but still haven’t found much consistency.
Three takeaways

Over the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data (and including playoffs), teams are 5-6,550 when trailing by at least 24 points in the fourth quarter. On Monday, the Wolves became the first team in almost six years to rally from 24 down in the fourth, scoring the last 16 points of regulation in Oklahoma City, and then getting a game-saving block from Anthony Edwards in overtime. Alas, they played two more close games later in the week and lost them both, falling to 16-23 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes.


After a second-half onslaught (with Julius Randle making his return from a 13-game absence) in Phoenix on Sunday, the Wolves are 17-6 in games that weren’t within five in the last five, with only the Thunder (39-3) and Cavs (31-4) having fewer non-clutch losses. Minnesota is now 33-29 with the point differential (fifth best in the West) of a team that’s 38-24. That’s the league’s biggest difference between a team’s “expected” wins and its actual wins.


One of those narrow losses came in Utah without Anthony Edwards, who was suspended a game after picking up his 16th technical foul of the season. Edwards seems to believe that he doesn’t get a fair whistle, but he’s drawn fouls on 12% of his drives, the second highest rate (lower than only that of Giannis Antetokounmpo) among 42 players with at least 500 total drives this season.

The Wolves have the Western Conference’s easiest remaining schedule regarding cumulative opponent winning percentage (.438) by a wide margin, and they’re two games into a stretch of six straight against teams with losing records. But their home-road back-to-back on Tuesday and Wednesday is the end of their second (and final) stretch of five games in seven days.

The Warriors’ five-game winning streak came to a disappointing end in Philadelphia on Saturday, but they’re still 7-1 with Jimmy Butler in the lineup.
Three takeaways

On Thursday in Orlando, Stephen Curry scored 56 points, tied for the third highest total for any player this season. It was just the second game in the 46 seasons of the 3-point line (Damian Lillard had the first) where a player made at least 12 3-pointers and at least 10 free throws. Two nights later, Curry dunked for the first time in more than six years. He’s averaged 30.4 points on 51/43/90 shooting splits over the nine games since Butler joined the Warriors.


The Warriors rank in the top five on both ends of the floor over that stretch, with the bigger improvement coming on offense. Their five games since the All-Star break have been their best five-game stretch of offense this season (league-best 126.2 points scored per 100 possessions).


Curry has led the way, but six other Warriors have averaged double-figures over the five games. Moses Moody seems to be getting comfortable in the starting lineup, having shot 12-for-24 from 3-point range since the break. That takes him to a career-best 38.8% for the season, with Moody having taken more than 60% of his shots (also a career-high rate) from beyond the arc.

The Warriors have 22 games left, 11 at home, 11 on the road, 11 against teams currently above .500, 11 against teams currently below, three with a rest advantage, and three with a rest disadvantage. They’re three games into a stretch where they’re playing 12 of 15 against the Eastern Conference, set to face the Knicks twice in 12 days.

The Bucks have won six of their last seven games and are nine games over .500 for the first time.
Three takeaways

The Bucks rank third defensively (107.4 points allowed per 100 possessions) since the All-Star break, with their best post-break win coming on Thursday, when they held Denver’s second-ranked offense to just 112 points on 108 possessions. The Nuggets scored 68 points in the paint, but that took 60 field goal attempts and the Bucks managed to defend all those shots without many fouls. Denver recorded its lowest free throw rate of the season.


Kyle Kuzma now has a worse effective field goal percentage in 10 games with the Bucks (46.1%) than he did in his 32 games with Washington (46.7%), but Milwaukee has outscored its opponents by 11.6 points per 100 possessions in Kuzma’s 103 total minutes alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and Brook Lopez. The current starting lineup has still played just 67 minutes together.


Bench minutes haven’t been bad either, though the Bucks have been without Bobby Portis (league suspension) for their six games since the break. AJ Green and Gary Trent Jr. combined to shoot 14-for-31 (45%) from 3-point range over the Bucks’ three wins last week, and the latter is now at a career-best 42% from beyond the arc for the season.

The Bucks are 0-8 vs. the top three teams in the East, with two games (both at home) remaining against that group. The first of those is Sunday, when they’ll be at a rest disadvantage against the Cavs.

The Pistons got clobbered by the Nuggets on Friday, but not before they ran their winning streak to eight games with quality wins over the Clippers and Celtics.
Three takeaways

Those two wins ended losing streaks of 10 games against the Clippers and 12 games against the Celtics, with the last win over LA happening the last time the Pistons made the playoffs (2018-19). They now lead the Heat by five games (four in the loss column) for sixth place and the final guaranteed playoff spot in the East.


The Pistons rank as the league’s most improved defensive team, allowing 5.9 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did in 2023-24. They held the Nets under 90 points per 100 possessions on Saturday, despite committing a season-high 27 turnovers on the other end of the floor. Over this 9-1 stretch, opponents have shot just 51.9% in the paint, the lowest opponent mark over the last 24 days.


The Pistons rank second in the percentage of their points (29.5%) that have come from fast breaks (16.7%, first) or second chances (12.8%, 11th), and it’s been in transition where they’ve flourished of late. They’ve averaged 28 fast break points over their last five games, even registering more than the Nuggets (22-21) in their loss on Friday. Denver (20.0) and Detroit (19.1) are averaging the most and second most fast break points for any team in the last six seasons.

The Pistons have still played the fewest games (they’re 10-7) against the West. They’ll play 13 of their next 18 games against the opposite conference, starting with a four-game trip that tips off in Utah.

Three takeaways

Norman Powell returned from a five-game absence on Sunday, but left late in the first quarter with a hamstring issue. The Clippers got a win without him in Chicago last week, but are now 1-9 since Thanksgiving when Powell hasn’t played (1-8) or logged fewer than 10 minutes.


The Clippers are one of three teams — the Hornets and Sixers are the others — that rank in the bottom 10 on both ends of the floor since the All-Star break. The bigger drop-off from before the break has been on defense, but with the Pelicans having seen some improvement of late, the Clippers are now the team that’s seen the league’s biggest drop in points scored per 100 possessions (-6.5) from last season.


Bogdan Bogdanović gave the Clippers a lift off the bench in their win in Chicago, but that came two nights after he shot 1-for-12 from 3-point range in his only start of the season. He has a lower effective field goal percentage in his eight games with LA (46.6%) than he did in 24 games with the Hawks (46.9%). The Clippers’ bench ranks 24th since the trade deadline, down from 13th prior.

After the Clippers visit the Suns on Tuesday, they’ll play 10 of their next 14 games against the Eastern Conference. But one of their most important games left on the schedule is Sunday night, when they host the ninth-place Kings, who they lead by just a half game.

The Mavs are 2-3 since the All-Star break, with the two wins having come by single digits against the Pelicans and Hornets.
Three takeaways

Though the absence of their three primary bigs would seemingly hurt more on defense, it’s on offense where the Mavs rank just 28th (104.9 points scored per 100 possessions) since the break. They’ve taken care of the ball well and haven’t been terrible from beyond the arc, but the interior offensive numbers have been bad. The Mavs rank in the bottom 10 in field goal percentage in the paint (26th), free throw rate (22nd) and offensive rebounding percentage (30th) since the break.


There hasn’t been much offense without Kyrie Irving, with the Mavs scoring an anemic 90 points per 100 possessions in his 54 post-break minutes off the floor. Irving got some support from Moses Brown (starting at center on a 10-day contract) on Saturday, but the Mavs had one of their worst defensive games of the season, allowing Milwaukee 132 points on 102 possessions. The Bucks attempted 35 free throws, with Brown, P.J. Washington and Danté Exum combining to commit 12 fouls in less than 49 total minutes on the floor.


Klay Thompson has been a bright spot, shooting 20-for-40 from 3-point range since the break to climb above 40% for the season. This would be his 10th season (tying him with Kyle Korver for second all-time) of shooting 40% or better on at least 250 3-point attempts.

It’s not a great time for the 10th-place Mavs to be playing one of their biggest games of the season, but they’ll host the ninth-place Kings on Monday. They lost the first two (of only three) meetings, so Sacramento owns the tie-breaker.

The Blazers continue to impress, winning four straight games before losing to the Cavs in overtime over the weekend.
Two takeaways

There are eight players with 30-point triple-doubles this season, seven current or former All-Stars and Deni Avdija, who had 30 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in Cleveland on Sunday. Avdija saw big jumps in both per-36 numbers and efficiency last season (finishing sixth in Most Improved voting) and has, basically, maintained those numbers in his first season in Portland.


Shaedon Sharpe submitted a dunk-of-the-year entry on his way to a career-high 36 points in Washington on Wednesday. Players with that kind of bounce can sometimes (see Derrick Jones Jr.) be effective on the offensive glass, though while his team ranks third in offensive rebounding percentage, Sharpe (2.6%) ranks just sixth among the 10 Blazers who’ve averaged at least 15 minutes per game. But he did have two big tip-ins to tie the game in Cleveland in the final two minutes of regulation.

The Blazers are playing the three best teams in the league in the span of six days. They’ve lost 15 straight games to the Thunder, with their seven-game trip concluding in Oklahoma City on Friday.

After getting clobbered by the Warriors in their first game after the All-Star break, the Kings have won three straight, earning an impressive win in Houston on Saturday.
Three takeaways

The Kings got comfortable wins over the Hornets and Jazz last week, even though their starting lineup was outscored by 15 points in its 20 minutes over the two games. Domantas Sabonis was lost to a hamstring injury in the first two minutes in Houston, but another burly Lithuanian (Jonas Valančiūnas) took his place and the Kings built a 19-3 lead. Valančiūnas finished 15 points, 14 rebounds, four steals and three blocks, making a couple of big defensive plays down the stretch (after that 16-point lead was erased).


Over the four weeks since the De’Aaron Fox trade, the Kings have had the league’s ninth-ranked bench and have been at their best (plus-8.3 points per 100 possessions) with Valančiūnas on the floor.


The Kings have scored 117.4 points per 100 possessions (eighth in the league) since the Fox trade, up from 115.2 (seventh) prior, though they haven’t moved up the rankings on that end of the floor. Interestingly, Sabonis has seen a drop in his time of possession, from 8.3% of his minutes on the floor pre-trade to 7.7% since.

The ninth-place Kings have four games remaining in the No. 6-10 tier in the West, and three of them (all on the road) are in the next 11 days. They’re 4-1 (with four straight wins) on the road against the other four teams in that tier, having won an OT thriller in Dallas last month. They’re back at American Airlines Center on Monday and will visit the Clippers (responsible for that one road loss) over the weekend.

The Heat would have their first three-game winning streak since early January if they had held onto a late lead on Sunday.
Three takeaways

The Heat led the Knicks by as many as 19 points on Sunday and were up 12 with a little more than eight minutes left in regulation, only to see that lead disappear and lose in overtime. They now have five losses in games they’ve led by double-digits in the fourth quarter, with no other team having more than three and eight teams having none.


Things are going wrong on both ends of the floor when you blow a double-digit lead in less than 12 minutes, but the offense has been particularly brutal (60 points on 79 possessions, 0.66 per) in those five fourth quarters. The Heat have scored a point per possession or less in 12 of their last 17 fourth quarters, with ugly fourth-quarter shooting numbers from most of their rotation (Duncan Robinson is an exception) over that stretch.


The Heat have two of their best offensive games of the season last week, with wins over the Hawks and Pacers being just the second and third times that they’ve scored more than 130 points per 100 possessions. Davion Mitchell was 7-for-7 from 3-point range over the two games and the Heat have scored a solid 116 points per 100 in his 298 minutes on the floor since he arrived at the trade deadline.

The Heat are just three games into a stretch where they’re playing 14 of 17 at home, but their overtime loss to the Knicks on Sunday was the start of their third (and final) stretch of five games in seven days. They’ll be at a rest disadvantage against the Wizards on Monday night and again against the Bulls over the weekend.

The Magic still haven’t been able to put it back together, and hope for a Jalen Suggs return is seemingly gone as the 23-year-old is set to have surgery on his left knee.
Three takeaways

Suggs, Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero have played just 97 total minutes (in six games) together this season. Over the last two seasons, Orlando is 43-26 (.623) when all three have been available and 31-42 (.425) otherwise.


Before Thursday, the Magic were 22-1 when they scored league-average efficiency (113.2 points per 100 possessions) or better. And they had a strong offensive game (115 on 96) against the Warriors, who ranked second defensively over their first seven games with Jimmy Butler. But Stephen Curry dropped 56 (mostly on Kentavious Caldwell-Pope) on the other end of the floor and it was the second straight game in which the Magic’s second-ranked defense got torched.


The Magic still haven’t had two straight better-than-average offensive games since November and Banchero is still registering the lowest true shooting percentage of his career (52.5%). But the last two games (losses to the Warriors and Raptors) have been two of his four most efficient scoring games of the season.

The Magic could use a win or two as their seven-game homestand concludes with another game against the Raptors and a visit from the Bulls, because their schedule will get tougher (and road-heavy) after that.

The Spurs are 2-5 since losing Victor Wembanyama at the All-Star break, sliding into the bottom 10 on defense and into 13th place in the Western Conference.
Two takeaways

Offense was a problem (101.5 points scored per 100 possessions) as the Spurs lost four straight games (including two to the Pelicans), with players not named Keldon Johnson registering an effective field goal percentage of just 43.7%. Even with the offense coming alive over the weekend, Stephon Castle (45.7%), De’Aaron Fox (43%) and Devin Vassell (42.2%) rank 48th, 52nd and 53rd in effective field goal percentage among 58 players with at least 75 post-break field goal attempts.


Castle totaled 56 points as the Spurs scored 127.8 points per 100 possessions against two top-10 defenses over the weekend, with Fox hitting the game-winner in Memphis on Saturday. Most encouraging may be that Castle’s 32 points against the Thunder came with a career-high four 3-pointers, with the rookie having shot just 4-for-22 over his first six games out of the break.

The Spurs have a busy final six weeks of the season, with Wednesday and Thursday being their final two-day break. Opportunities to play spoiler will come after that, with 14 of their next 20 games against teams currently sporting winning records.

The Hawks split their home-and-home set with the Heat, but have lost five of their last six games overall and are six games under .500 for the first time.
Three takeaways

The Hawks’ win over the Heat last Monday was, statistically, their best defensive game of the season (86 points allowed on 97 possessions). Otherwise, they’ve allowed more than 127 per 100 over this 1-5 stretch. They’ve slid from 13th to 18th on defense over the last three weeks, and this would be the first time in the last five seasons that they were worse than average on both ends of the floor.


Caris LeVert has come off the bench in all eight games with the Hawks, but he’s played 154 (70%) of his 222 minutes with Trae Young. And Young already has 18 assists to LeVert, just five shy of anybody in the latter’s 38 games with the Cavs (Darius Garland had 23). The Hawks have scored 116.8 points per 100 possessions in those 154 minutes with Young and LeVert on the floor together.


The Hawks still have a winning record (12-11) against the eight teams ahead of them in the Eastern Conference standings, with two wins each against the top four. The only team in the top eight that they haven’t beat is Indiana (0-1).

They’ll face the Pacers twice on a six-game homestand (their longest of the season) that begins Tuesday with a visit from the Bucks. The Hawks are just 2-8 at State Farm Arena since mid-January.

The Suns couldn’t take advantage of their last soft stretch of schedule, and now they’ve begun the gauntlet.
Three takeaways

The Suns have had the league’s worst defense (121.3 points allowed per 100 possessions), going 3-11 since Feb. 1 while falling to 27th on defense this season. They’re in the middle of the pack in three of the four factors on defense, but are 28th in opponent turnover rate, ranking last (10.5 per 100 possessions) over these last 14 games.


Related to the lack of forced turnovers … Bol Bol, now in the starting lineup and all arms and legs, averages just 1.0 deflections per 36 minutes, the fourth lowest rate among 374 players who’ve played at least 300 minutes this season. On the other side of the floor, he has a true shooting percentage of 79.8% since the All-Star break, the best mark among 131 players with at least 50 post-break field goal attempts.


The Suns seem like they’re trying to win games, but are now four games out of the final Play-In spot in the West, with the league’s toughest remaining schedule by a healthy margin. Of course, some of those tough games are against the five teams (with 28 or 29 losses) that they could chase down if they started playing a lot better than they have been.

Beginning with their loss to the Wolves (one of those five teams) on Sunday, the Suns are playing 19 of their final 22 games against teams that currently have winning records. They’re 11-21 against that group thus far, including 0-6 since Feb. 1. The Clippers and Mavs are also in that 6-10 group and the Suns will face them both this week.

The Pelicans have shown some signs of life, winning five of their last seven games.
Two takeaways

The bigger difference between this 5-2 stretch (112.6 points allowed per 100 possessions) and the 10-game losing streak that preceded it (125.3 allowed per 100) has been on defense. But wins in Phoenix and Utah last week were just the seventh and eighth times this season that the Pels have scored more than 125 per 100. Zion Williamson totaled 51 points and 20 assists over the two games (missing the Pelicans’ loss in Phoenix on Friday) and has shot 65% over his last eight, up from 52% prior.


The Pelicans’ ups and downs over the last two months have been schedule-aided. Going back to early January, they’ve won 10 of their last 14 games against other teams that are currently below .500. They got a win over the Kings in their last game before the All-Star break, but they now have the third biggest differential between their record vs. that bottom-14 group (13-13, .500) and their record against the 16 teams currently above .500 (4-31, .114).

Now it’s time to get back to playing the good teams, with nine of the Pelicans’ next 11 games against the top 16. They’re 0-2 against the Rockets, having allowed 127.9 points per 100 possessions over the two losses and set to complete the season series with two more meetings this week.

After a 7-2 stretch, the Nets have dropped four straight games, with losses to the Wizards and Blazers included.
Three takeaways

Weirdly, the Nets’ one good offensive game (121 points on 100 possessions) during the losing streak came against the No. 1 defense in the league. With Nic Claxton suspended, Day’Ron Sharpe got the start and scored a career-high 25 points on 8-for-10 from the field and 7-for-7 from the line against the Thunder on Wednesday, when the Nets took 61 (66%) of their 93 shots from 3-point range. That’s the highest rate for any team in a game this season.


Sharpe has still played just 673 total minutes this season, but will be an interesting restricted free agent this summer. The Nets have now been 13.6 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (plus-3.6) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-10.0), with that being the fourth biggest on-off differential among players who’ve played at least 500 minutes for a single team.


The Nets’ only two lineups that have played more than 61 minutes include two guys – Dennis Schröder and Dorian Finney-Smith – who were traded in December. Keon Johnson, Cam Johnson, Ziaire Williams and Claxton have started eight of the last 10 games together, but the Nets have been outscored by 16.6 points per 100 possessions (scoring an anemic 89.9 per 100) in 137 total minutes with those four guys all on the floor. Cam Thomas returned from a 40-game, three-month absence on Friday, moving Keon Johnson back to the bench.

Thomas sat out the Nets’ loss in Detroit on Saturday (the second game of a back-to-back), but should be available for all three games this week. The Nets will have a rest advantage in Charlotte on Saturday, having won their first three meetings with the Hornets.

The Bulls are still just 6-17 since mid-January, but they won their two most important games last week, blowing out the 11th-place Sixers and edging the 13th-place Raptors in overtime.
Two takeaways

The Bulls have played their last four games (and are now 3-2) without Nikola Vučević, who’s been rather durable over the course of his career. Zach Collins has started in his place and has shot 24-for-33 (73%) inside the arc (though just 6-for-23 from deep) over his seven games with Chicago. The Bulls have been at their best (plus-12.5 per 100 possessions) with Collins on the floor over that stretch.


The Bulls have still seen the league’s third biggest drop in clutch winning percentage from last season, but they rank sixth in clutch defense (102.5 points allowed per 100 possessions) and pulled a victory out of their hat on Friday, with Coby White tying the game with a four-point play with four seconds left in regulation. Ayo Dosunmu returned from a three-game absence in that one and was on the floor (instead of Matas Buzelis) down the stretch as Chicago held the Raptors to just 11 points on 18 clutch possessions.

The Bulls are 4-3 against the other three East teams in Play-In position, set to visit the Magic (1-1) and Heat (1-0) this week. Their game in Miami on Saturday is one of six rest-advantage games left on their schedule.

The Raptors still have the league’s easiest remaining schedule by a huge margin, but they’re five games out of a Play-In spot, having lost a heartbreaker to the 10th-place Bulls on Friday.
Two takeaways

The Raptors led that game by 16 early in the fourth quarter and by four in the closing seconds, only to foul Coby White as he drained a 3-pointer, losing in overtime. It was déjà vu all over again two nights later in Orlando, when they blew almost all of a 19-point, fourth-quarter lead and then gave the Magic a chance to tie or take the lead with a backcourt turnover in the final seconds. But Franz Wagner missed a layup and the Raptors improved to 6-14 in games that were within three points in the final minute of the fourth quarter.


Immanuel Quickley (the guy who fouled White) has now been available for 10 straight games, averaging 18.5 points and 5.4 assists. The Raptors have outscored their opponents by 1.5 points per 100 possessions in Quickley’s 317 minutes on the floor over that stretch, but have been outscored by 20.4 per 100 in his 173 minutes on the bench.

The Raptors are just two games into a stretch of 10 straight against teams with losing records, now 12-10 in games played between the 14 teams currently below .500.

The Sixers got some clarity on Joel Embiid, shutting him down for the season (in which he played 19 games) on Friday. They then got a win, halting a nine-game losing streak by surviving a comeback from the Warriors.
Two takeaways

The Sixers’ game against the 10th-place Bulls last Monday was their biggest opportunity to show that they cared about making the Eastern Conference Play-In and having an opportunity to make the playoffs. And midway through the fourth quarter, they trailed by 50 points. The good news was that the loss came with Paul George’s highest usage rate in February, showing that he was more engaged offensively. He topped that rate two nights later in New York, and hit a big (dagger) shot in the win over Golden State.


The other good news is that the Sixers seem (at this point) to have won the trade with Dallas that brought them Quentin Grimes, who scored a career-high 44 points on Saturday. Of course, Grimes will need to be paid (he’s a restricted free agent this summer) and Philly has still been outscored by 16 points per 100 possessions (with terrible defensive numbers) in 139 total minutes with Grimes, George and Tyrese Maxey on the floor together.

With their loss on Sunday, the Jazz were swept in the three-game season series by the 14th-place Pelicans, whom they now trail by a game and a half at the bottom of the Western Conference.
Two takeaways

The Jazz did get a clutch win over the shorthanded Wolves on Friday, with John Collins deftly assisting Walker Kessler on the game-winning dunk. Utah has still outscored opponents (by 2.8 points per 100 possessions) with Collins and Kessler on the floor together, though that was the only game in the last five in which Collins played and Kessler (though he’s only 23 years old) seems to get almost as many days off as some of the Jazz’s older vets.


Opponents have shot 54.1% at the rim when Kessler has been there, a solid mark (eighth among 48 players who’ve defended at least 200 shots at the rim), but not quite as good as his first two seasons (51.2%). His 2.8 blocks per 36 minutes are also a big drop from 3.7 per 36 over his first two years, though he’s also committing fewer fouls.

The Pistons and Jazz are tied for the most interconference games remaining on their schedule (13), and they’ll meet in Utah on Monday.

The Wizards still have three fewer wins than every other team, but they climbed into double-digits by beating the Nets and Hornets last week. The first of those two wins also put an end to their 27-game, two-year losing streak in the second games of back-to-backs.
Two takeaways

The two wins last week weren’t pretty, but the Wizards now rank 14th defensively (114.2 points allowed per 100 possessions) since Feb. 1. Their opponents have actually shot better from 3-point range over their 12 games than they did previously, but the the Wizards rank fourth in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (54.0%) since Feb. 1, an improvement from 27th (59.3%) through January.


They haven’t played a lot, but the Wizards have allowed just 102.5 points per 100 possessions in 166 total minutes with Marcus Smart and/or Khris Middleton on the floor. Richaun Holmes, meanwhile, has been remarkably efficient (shooting 78% from the field) since joining the rotation in late January, starting several games in place of Alex Sarr.

The Wizards are 7-48 against the rest of the league, but they went 4-0 against the Hornets, completing the season sweep on Saturday. That extended Charlotte’s current losing streak to six games.
Two takeaways

The good news is that the last two losses have come by a total of only 20 points, with the previous three having come by a total of 131. There’s been some improvement on defense, but the Hornets have scored a paltry 91.5 points per 100 possessions over the last five games overall and have put themselves in danger of falling into the basement in offensive efficiency for the season.


LaMelo Ball has shot just 11-for-42 (26%) over the three games he’s played during the losing streak, and with their losses at Golden State and Dallas last week, the Hornets are 1-23 without Ball (1-21) or when he’s played fewer than 12 minutes (0-2). Two-way player KJ Simpson started in Ball’s place last week and had just seven assists in more than 66 minutes over the two games.

The Hornets’ loss to Washington on Friday was a start of a five-game homestand, with the next three games coming against teams that rank in the top eight defensively.

The Cavs clinched a playoff spot on Wednesday, but they haven’t slowed down, and their winning streak is now at 14 games.
Three takeaways

The Cavs still aren’t very close to ranking in the top five defensively for the season, but they’re second on that end of the floor since the All-Star break. They’ve seen a drop in opponent 3-point percentage, but also lead the league in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (52%) since the break, down from 55.4% (seventh) before the break.


They’ve allowed just 104.8 in De’Andre Hunter’s 299 minutes. Hunter has been on the floor down the stretch of all the Cavs’ close games since he arrived, but has played most of his minutes at the four and the Cavs have outscored their opponents by 19.7 points per 100 possessions in 283 minutes with Hunter on the floor with only one of the two starting bigs. He’s played just 21 total minutes in place of Max Strus and with the other four starters.


The Cleveland offense also ranks second since the All-Star break, despite some struggles from Darius Garland. He has an effective field goal percentage of just 42.1% since the break, down from 59.4% prior. That’s the biggest drop among 126 players with at least 200 field goal attempts before the break and 75 since.

The Cavs are 25-4 (with nine straight wins) against the nine Eastern Conference teams that currently have losing records, set to host the Nets (3-0) and Magic (2-0) this week.

The Thunder have put together another winning streak (their fourth of at least seven games) and continue to run away with the best record in the Western Conference.
Three takeaways

The league’s No. 1 defense had seen some slippage, allowing 119.1 points per 100 possessions over a six-game stretch that ended with a 137-128 win over the shorthanded Rockets (missing four starters) last Monday. But they’ve held the Grizzlies, Blazers and Nuggets to just 96.4 per 100 (and just 50.4% shooting in the paint) over the last three games.


They’re still not forcing a lot of turnovers. Thunder opponents have committed just 13.8 per 100 possessions (15th in the league) over the last nine, down from 18.0 per 100 (highest by a wide margin) prior. Oklahoma City (5) and Denver (8) combined for just 13 total turnovers (second lowest total of the season) on Sunday.


The offense still ranks first (123.9 points scored per 100 possessions) since the All-Star break. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has scored 40 or more points in each of his last three games and is now averaging 34.6 per 36 minutes, which would be the fourth highest mark in NBA history for a player who played at least 2,000 minutes.

After the Thunder play the second game of their back-to-back against the Nuggets, they’ll play five straight games against the Eastern Conference. They’re currently 21-1 against the East (what would be the best record for any team against the opposite conference in NBA history), but a tough, three-game trip tips off in Boston on Wednesday.

After losing the first game of their seven-game homestand to the Cavs, the Celtics have won four straight, beating the second and third place teams in the West along the way.
Three takeaways

The Lakers beat the Celtics at their own game on Saturday, making one more 3-pointer (14-13) than the hosts. But the Celtics beat the Lakers (first in free throw differential) at their own game, outscoring them by nine points at the line. Boston ranks second in opponent free throw rate (20.1 attempts per 100 shots from the field), with a rate of just 16.1 per 100 (lowest in the league by a wide margin) over the last four weeks.


With Kristaps Porziņģis out a fifth straight game, Al Horford’s defense was under the microscope on Saturday. Luka Dončić scored 16 of his 34 points (shooting 4-for-7) against Horford, but the Lakers scored just a point per possession in Horford’s 37 minutes on the floor. According to Second Spectrum tracking, opponents have scored just 0.89 points per possession when Horford has defended a ball-screen that has led directly to a shot, trip to the line or turnover. That ranks sixth among 83 players who’ve defended at least 250 direct ball-screens and is down from 0.97 points per possession last season.


The Celtics are 12-4 without Jrue Holiday, but his recent, four-game absence (before his return on Saturday) was one of their worst stretches of defense (118.8 points allowed per 100 possessions) this season. Their offense hasn’t been at nearly the same level as it was last season with their four perimeter starters on the floor, but their defense has been terrific (107.0 allowed per 100) in 654 total minutes with Holiday, Derrick White, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum together.

The Celtics have just four games remaining against teams with winning records, with their game against the Thunder on Wednesday the most intriguing on the schedule (league-wide). Their early-January, 13-point loss in Oklahoma City was their worst offensive game of the season (92 points on 97 possessions).

The Lakers’ eight-game winning streak ended in Boston on Saturday. Worse is that LeBron James suffered a groin injury that will have him out for at least as many games as he’s missed to date (four).
Three takeaways

James was playing some terrific basketball, averaging 28.4 points (on an effective field goal percentage of 60.4%), 10.3 rebounds and 7.2 assists since Feb. 1. He was one assist from his 11th triple-double when he was injured, with this being only the fourth of his 22 seasons in which he’s had at least 10.


The Lakers have played just 108 minutes with Luka Dončić on the floor without James, but they’ve outscored their opponents by 46 points (22.6 per 100 possessions) in those 108 minutes. Dončić seemed to be dealing with a back issue on Saturday, but has averaged 31.2 points over the last five games, his highest-scoring five-game stretch of the season.


L.A. is 3-1 without James and it’s better for him to miss games now than six weeks from now. But it’s still not a good time for him to be injured, because a brutal stretch of schedule is coming. Starting with their game in Milwaukee on Thursday (and thanks to a postponement), the Lakers will play three straight back-to-backs and six games in nine days. Stretches of four games in five nights don’t exist (on the normal schedule) anymore, and the Lakers essentially have two of them overlapping each other.

That stretch includes their two remaining games against the third-place Nuggets, whom they lead by one game in the loss column. They’ve split the first two meetings, with the road team winning both by more than 20 points.

The Warriors keep winning. They’re now 11-1 with Jimmy Butler in uniform, though they remain in a tight race for the final guaranteed playoff spot in the West.
Three takeaways

Stephen Curry had a sub-par shooting night (4-for-15 from 3-point range) against the Pistons on Saturday, so Draymond Green hit the go-ahead 3 in what was the Warriors’ 38th clutch game (second most). Green had missed his previous 11 clutch 3-point attempts (his last make was Jan. 19, 2023) before that and still has accounted for just 5.5% of the Warriors’ buckets when he’s been on the floor in clutch time this season. That’s the second lowest rate among 154 players who’ve played at least 50 clutch minutes.


Curry has handled the ball more since Butler’s addition (5.3 minutes per game, 17.5% of his time on the floor) than he did prior (4.5 minutes, 14.1%). But he’s seen a drop in the percentage of his shots (from 56% to 50%) that have been self-created, per Second Spectrum tracking.


The bigger improvement since adding Butler has come on offense, but the Warriors have now allowed just 106.7 points per 100 possessions (forcing 18.3 turnovers per 100) in the 12 games he’s played in, including just 103.0 per 100 in Butler’s 378 minutes on the floor.

Their win over the Pistons started the Warriors’ longest homestand of the season (seven games over 13 days), and they’ll have a rest advantage against the Blazers on Monday. They’re still just 2 1/2 games ahead of the ninth-place Kings, who they’ll host three nights later.

The Nuggets have been pretty good about taking care of business, but with their 24-point loss in Oklahoma City on Sunday afternoon, they’ve dropped their last 10 games within the top nine in the league.
Three takeaways

That losing streak within the top nine goes back to November and the Nuggets have lost those 10 games by an average of 15.8 points. They have allowed the opponents to score an amazing 127 per 100 possessions in the 10 losses, and their last two games (an overtime win against the Suns and the loss in Oklahoma City) were the ninth and 10th times they’ve allowed more than 125 per 100. They did that just seven times last season, when league-average efficiency was higher.


Overall, the Nuggets have allowed 1.0 more points per 100 possessions than the league average (113.4 per 100), which would be their worst defensive mark in the last seven seasons.


Aaron Gordon returned from a three-game absence on Friday, but played 39 minutes as the Nuggets went to overtime against the Suns and then left in the first quarter of their loss in Oklahoma City on Sunday afternoon with a calf issue. The Nuggets haven’t been much worse in 609 minutes with their other three returning starters — Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokić — on the floor without Gordon (plus-10.1 points per 100 possessions) than they’ve been in 468 minutes with all four on the floor (plus-10.6 per 100). The offense has been a little better and the defense has been a little worse without Gordon.

Their loss in Oklahoma City on Sunday was the start of the Nuggets’ third (and final) stretch of five games in seven days, though they’ll have a rest advantage against the second-place Lakers (who will be without LeBron James) on Friday. Denver (6-0) is one of three teams — the Celtics and Cavs are the others — that are undefeated in rest-advantage games.

The Knicks played three good teams last week, and they’ve lost three straight games for the second time this season, losing Jalen Brunson to an ankle injury along the way.
Three takeaways

The Knicks have scored just 106.3 points per 100 possessions (28th) since the All-Star break, down from 119.9 (second) before the break. That’s the league’s biggest drop by a healthy margin, with the losing streak being their worst three-game stretch of offense all season (101.7 per 100) and their loss to the Clippers on Friday without Brunson being just the second time they’ve scored less than a point per possession.


Karl-Anthony Towns (from 59.6% to 49.6%) and Miles McBride (from 52.7% to 45.1%) have seen the seventh and 11th biggest post-break drops in effective field goal percentage among 126 players with at least 200 field goal attempts before the break and 75 since. Towns has seen a drop in the paint, but it’s mostly about 3-point percentage (43.8% vs. 30.8%). The Knicks have shot below 30% from beyond the arc in each of the last three games.


The Knicks are 1-5 since the All-Star break (they were 11-11 before the break) against other teams currently with winning records.

The rest of the Knicks’ five-game trip includes another game against the Warriors, who came back from a double-digit deficit at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. Brunson is out, but the Knicks will have a rest advantage in Sacramento on Monday, with their previous meeting with the Kings (a 23-point win in late January) having been one of their best offensive games of the season.

Playing against a soft stretch of schedule, the Wolves have won five straight games. They’re eight games over .500 for the first time, and they’re still in the fight for a top-six spot in the West.
Three takeaways

With Rudy Gobert returning from a 10-game absence on Sunday, the Wolves are healthy again. They managed to rank 12th defensively over Gobert’s time on the shelf, even though it included their three games against the Thunder. This win streak has been one of their best stretches of offense all season (125.1 points scored per 100 possessions), with five players averaging more than 15 points over the five games.


With that, the Wolves are now one of five teams that rank in the top 10 on both ends of the floor. They have finished in the top 10 on both ends just once (2003-04) in their first 35 seasons.


The Wolves have a shot at a guaranteed playoff spot, and they have the easiest remaining schedule of the four teams in the No. 6-9 tier in the West, with nine of their 16 remaining games against teams currently below .500. With their five-game winning streak, they’re 16-2 against that group since Christmas, having scored 118.7 points per 100 possessions over those 18 games.

The Wolves have also won four straight games against the Nuggets (going back to Game 6 of the Western Conference semis), and they’ll have two days off before playing in Denver on Wednesday. They’ll then begin a five-game homestand with a visit from the Magic.

Tyrese Haliburton (hip issue) has missed the last two games, and the Pacers lost them both (in Atlanta), but still have a big opportunity this week.
Three takeaways

Haliburton had been terrific since the All-Star break, registering an effective field goal percentage of 75%, the best mark among 131 players with at least 75 post-break field goal attempts. He had also averaged 12.5 assists with an assist/turnover ratio of 10.71 over his last six games, recording at least 10 in all six.


Before the two games in Atlanta, the Pacers had scored 10.5 more points per 100 possessions with Haliburton on the floor (116.8) than they had with him off the floor (106.3). They were relatively efficient (117.4 per 100) in the two-game series overall, but scored just 13 points on 17 clutch possessions, losing the two games by a total of eight points.


Bennedict Mathurin returned from a four-game absence on Saturday and played 40 minutes off the bench, scoring a team-high 30 points. He’s registering career-best marks for effective field goal percentage (53.4%) and true shooting percentage (58.7%), shooting 57.9% in the paint, up from 49.2% through his first two seasons.

The Pacers will be at a rest disadvantage (having played the night before) for both of their meetings against the Bucks this week, and they’ve scored just 106.5 points per 100 possessions (their third worst mark vs. any opponent) as they’ve dropped their first two games against Milwaukee.

The Grizzlies lost Jaren Jackson Jr. halfway through a four-game losing streak at home. But they took care of business with wins in Dallas and New Orleans over the weekend.
Three takeaways

The Grizzlies have allowed 6.4 fewer points per 100 possessions with Jackson on the floor (107.3) than they have with him off the floor (113.7), which is a huge differential for a starter. It’s mostly about the interior, as the Grizzlies have done a much better job of defending the paint, avoiding fouls and rebounding with Jackson on the floor.


But they were able to dominate inside without Jackson over the weekend. The Grizzlies didn’t shoot very well in the paint against the Mavs on Friday, but paint points were 74-38 in their favor, because their 74 shots in the paint were the most for any team this season. Over the two wins combined, they outscored their opponents by 21 points (50-29) on second chances. This season, the Grizzlies rank first in paint differential (plus-8.3 per game) and sixth in second-chance differential (plus-1.6).


Ja Morant still hasn’t played in more than five straight games all season and is still just 10-for-55 (18%) from 3-point range since the All-Star break, but the weekend wins came with his first two 30-point games in three months.

The Grizzlies’ win in New Orleans on Sunday was the start of their second (and final) stretch of five games in seven days. The rest of it is a four-game homestand that includes games against the Suns and Heat where both teams will be on the back end of a back-to-back.

The Rockets are still in fifth place, but they’re just two games into a stretch of playing 12 of 13 against teams with losing records. That run began with a home-and-home sweep of the Pelicans.
Three takeaways

The Rockets’ win over New Orleans on Saturday was their 10th in which they never trailed and their most efficient offensive performance (146 points on 101 possessions) of the season by a healthy margin. It came with 11 assists (with some really good vision included) from Amen Thompson, who finished one rebound shy of his fourth triple-double of the season, spraining his ankle in the fourth quarter.


As Fred VanVleet has missed 15 of the last 16 games with his own ankle injury, Thompson (who is expected to miss a couple of weeks) has averaged a team-high 5.9 assists (up from 2.9 prior). Houston has been 8.2 points per 100 possessions better with the 22-year-old on the floor (plus-2.0) than it has been with him off it (minus-6.2) over that stretch.


Dillon Brooks was 7-for-11 from 3-point range on Saturday and is registering career-high marks for both 3-point rate (52.8% of his shots) and 3-point percentage (39.4%). But he’s shot just 44.2% in the paint and has still yet to have a season where his effective field goal percentage or true shooting percentage weren’t worse than the league average.

The Saturday win began the Rockets’ longest homestand of the season (six games over 10 days). The only team they haven’t faced this season is the Magic, with two meetings coming in the next 10 days.

The bigger difference for the Clippers has been on defense, where they held two top-10 offenses to just 103.5 points per 100 possessions over the weekend.


Leonard was just 2-for-11 on clutch shots before Sunday’s game-winner, which came at the end of his first 40-minute night in more than 14 months (since Jan. 3, 2024). He’s still yet to find a real groove offensively (he’s 3-for-19 from 3-point range over his last three games) or play in both games of a back-to-back, but the Clippers have been strong when he’s been on the floor with other starters.


James Harden is two years older than Leonard, has played in 61 of the Clippers’ 64 games and scored 50 points (his most in 139 games with the Clippers) in their win over the Pistons on Wednesday. He still hasn’t seen any real surge in efficiency, but his ability to carry a huge load offensively has been critical, especially with Norman Powell having missed all but nine minutes of the last 10 games.

The Clippers will now head out on a three-game trip that begins with a New Orleans-Miami back-to-back. They have 10 games remaining against teams currently under .500, with four of those 10 coming this week.

With the Knicks on a slide and missing Jalen Brunson, the Bucks might have a shot at the No. 3 seed in the East (if they want it). But they lost both games of a weekend back-to-back at home and will be trying to hold onto fourth place with two games against the Pacers this week.
Three takeaways

The Bucks defended the Cavs’ top-ranked offense pretty well inside the arc on Sunday, but they were outscored by 30 points from 3-point range, where Cleveland shot 19-for-47 (40%). More concerning may be that, with the weekend losses to the Magic and Cavs, the Bucks’ offense has scored just 103.8 points per 100 possessions over its last seven games against teams that currently rank in the top 10 defensively.


Giannis Antetokounmpo was the only Buck who scored somewhat efficiently over the weekend. He also had 32 points in less than 25 minutes against Dallas on Wednesday, with all 20 of his field goal attempts coming inside the arc. His 3-point rate is a career-low 4.1% and Antetokounmpo is now shooting 46.8% from midrange, fifth (right behind Damian Lillard) among 24 players with at least 150 mid-range attempts, easily the best mark of his career (previous high was 41.5%) and up from 35.1% last season.


The Bucks have still played just 24 games (two fewer than any other team) against the 15 teams that currently have winning records. Their loss to the Cavs on Sunday was the first of eight straight games (and dropped them to 9-15) against that group. That includes a 0-9 mark against the top three teams in the East, with one game (March 28 vs. the Knicks) remaining.

The loss on Sunday was also the Bucks’ 13th and final rest-disadvantage game of the season. They’ve played just seven rest-advantage games thus far, but have four remaining, including two against the Pacers (with fourth place in the East on the line) this week.

The Pistons went 2-2 on a trip out West, beating the two opponents — Utah and Portland — likely heading to the Lottery. They also lost to the two — the Clippers and Warriors — who are comfortably above .500.
Three takeaways

The Pistons are 10-19 (.345) in games played between the 15 teams currently over. 500, which includes Detroit’s post-All-Star break wins against the Clippers and Celtics. Only the Kings (9-20) have a worse mark, and the bigger difference for Detroit between those 29 games and their 36 games against the bottom 15 teams in the league has been on defense, where they allowed the Clippers and Warriors to attempt 67 free throws last week.


The Pistons also have the league’s biggest differential between their record when they’ve won the first quarter (28-9, .757) and their record when they’ve lost the first quarter (6-20, .231). Since Feb. 5, they’ve won the 11 games they haven’t trailed after 12 minutes and lost the four games they have (even though they erased early deficits against both the Clippers and Warriors last week).


Cade Cunningham continues to put up big numbers (31.3 points and 7.3 assists over the four-game trip), but those big numbers extend into the turnovers column. He had 28 turnovers over the four games, with the biggest being a steal by Moses Moody (with the Pistons down two) in the final minute of their loss at Golden State on Saturday.

Their win in Portland on Sunday was the start of a stretch where the Pistons are playing eight of nine games against teams currently below .500, with their schedule set to get much tougher after that. They haven’t seen the Wizards since mid-November, when Cunningham had a triple-double with five steals in a 20-point win. Their final two meetings are Tuesday and Thursday in Detroit.

The Kings remain in the mix for a top-six spot in the West, but injuries have come at a bad time.
Three takeaways

The Kings have been without Domantas Sabonis (hamstring strain) for the last five games and lost Malik Monk to a toe injury last week. The offense (which ranks seventh since the De’Aaron Fox trade) hasn’t suffered, with Sacramento scoring 120.7 points per 100 possessions over Sabonis’ absence. The ball has mostly been in the hands of DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine, who’ve combined to average 51.4 points over the five games. LaVine has been the much more efficient former Bull, now shooting 31-for-59 (53%) from 3-point range since the All-Star break.


Statistically, the Kings have been the league’s fourth most improved team since the All-Star break, 9.6 points per 100 possessions better than they were before the break. Before Wednesday, they had won four straight games by an average of 23.3 points per game. They’re the only team in the top five in post-break improvement on both ends of the floor.


But they lost their first two clutch games since the break, blowing fourth-quarter leads to the Nuggets and Clippers. DeRozan (6-for-11) and LaVine (2-for-7) took 18 of their 22 clutch shots over the two games. That dropped them back below .500 (16-18) in clutch games for the season.

The Kings have just two games remaining within the 6-9 tier in the West, with the first on Thursday when they visit Golden State. They got clobbered by the Warriors in their first game out of the All-Star break, but still trail them by just two games in the loss column and would hold the head-to-head tie-breaker with a win this week.

With a 3-1 March, the Hawks have climbed into seventh place, the spot for the best Eastern Conference team with a losing record.
Three takeaways

With two wins over the Pacers (who were without Tyrese Haliburton) last week, the Hawks are 11-10 against the six teams with winning records in the East. They have two wins against each of the top five teams and have scored more efficiently in those 21 games (114.4 points per 100 possessions) than they have otherwise (110.7), even though the player who’s taken the most shots (Trae Young) has an effective field goal percentage of just 47%.


Young was just 1-for-10 on clutch shots last week, with all four of the Hawks’ games being within five points in the last five minutes. But Caris LeVert was 6-for-8, with the game-winning layup at the buzzer in Memphis after an incredible defensive play from Dyson Daniels. Twenty of the Hawks’ 30 wins have come in the clutch, with only the Hornets (12/15) having a higher rate.


LeVert continues to come off the bench, but has been on the floor in all eight of the Hawks’ clutch games since he arrived. Zaccharie Risacher has been in the starting lineup since October and Mouhamed Gueye has started 11 of the last 12 games, but the two have played 19 and seven of the Hawks’ 151 clutch minutes, respectively.

The Hawks have the easiest remaining schedule of the three teams in the No. 7-9 range in the East. They’ll play five of their next seven games against three of the bottom five teams in the East, currently 6-4 against the bottom five.

Might the Blazers be the team that takes the final SoFi Play-In Tournament spot from the Mavs? They have the best post-break record among the teams behind Dallas, even though they’ve lost three straight games.
Three takeaways

The Blazers got the Thunder’s B Team (all of their starters were out) on Friday and had a rest advantage against the Pistons two nights later. But they lost both games, scoring just 97.1 points per 100 possessions over the weekend. Defense continues to be where Portland has seen the bigger improvement as it has gone 15-9 since mid-January. Only the Lakers have allowed fewer points per 100 possessions than Portland (109.3) over that stretch.


The biggest source of the improvement has been opponent 3-point shooting: 38% (30th) through their first 41 games and just 32.4% (third) over the last 24. So there’s probably some luck involved there. The Blazers have also seen improvement in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (from 18th to fifth) and defensive rebounding percentage (from 30th to 16th).


The Blazers have been 15.6 points per 100 possessions better with Scoot Henderson on the floor (plus-12.1) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-3.5) over these last 24 games. The bigger difference has been on offense, where Henderson now has a true shooting percentage of 55.2%, up from 48.9% last season. That’s the third biggest jump among 103 players with at least 500 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons.

As they try to climb the standings in the West, the Blazers will have to win some more games against the East. After they visit the Warriors (with a rest disadvantage) on Monday, they’ll play nine of their next 12 games against the opposite conference. Their second seven-game homestand begins Wednesday with a visit from the Knicks.

The Mavs’ injuries have opened the door to the Western Conference Play-In Club for the Suns, and they took a step toward that door by beating Dallas on Sunday. But (many) tougher games await.
Three takeaways

Last week was certainly the Suns’ best since the start of February. They beat a good team (the Clippers), took the Nuggets to overtime in Denver, and handled their business against the shorthanded Mavs. It was their best three-game stretch of offense (128.3 points scored per 100 possessions) all season, with six guys averaging double-figures over the three games. Two of those were centers Nick Richards and Mason Plumlee, who combined to average 31 points on 76% shooting.


Of course, with the loss in Denver (in which the Nuggets scored an amazing 24 points on 13 overtime possessions), the Suns became the fourth team to surpass its loss total from last season (49-33). They’ve seen the league’s fourth biggest drop in winning percentage and its third biggest drop in point differential per 100 possessions (-5.1).


When you take the league average into account, the much bigger drop-off from last season has come on defense. The Suns are the only team that’s gotten worse in each of the four factors (opponent shooting, free throw rate, turnover rate and rebounding percentage) on that end of the floor.

The Suns now trail the Mavs by just a game and a half, but still have the league’s toughest remaining schedule, with 15 of their 18 remaining games against teams currently over .500.

The Magic went 1-6 on a seven-game homestand, with three losses to the Raptors (x 2) and Bulls included. But they hit the road and got a quality win in Milwaukee on Saturday.
Three takeaways

There was a time when the Magic looked like one of the league’s most improved teams. But on Thursday, they became the sixth team to match its loss total from last season (47-35). They’ve seen improvement (even when you take the league-average drop) defensively, but on the other end of the floor…


Orlando ranked 22nd offensively last season and has seen the league’s fourth-biggest drop in points scored per 100 possessions (-5.1), set to rank in the bottom 10 on that end of the floor for the 13th straight year. The last time the Magic didn’t rank in the bottom 10 offensively was the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, when their leading scorers were Dwight Howard, Ryan Anderson and Jameer Nelson.


The Bucks shot 48% from 3-point range on Saturday, but that was on only 23 attempts and Orlando (12-for-32) outscored them by three points from beyond the arc in a two-point win. The Magic rank 26th in opponent 3-point percentage (37.0%), but continue to have the league’s lowest 3-point rate (38.1% of opponent shots) and are now 17-10 when they’ve outscored their opponent from beyond the arc.

Their win in Milwaukee on Saturday starts both a five-game trip and a stretch where the Magic are playing five of six against teams that rank in the top 10 defensively. Their visit to Cleveland on Sunday is both a playoff rematch and a potential playoff preview, with the Cavs having won by 40 in Orlando less than two weeks ago.

The Heat have slid to ninth place in the East, having gone 1-4 on their third (and final) stretch of five games in seven days.
Three takeaways

The four losses came by a total of 16 points, with the Heat struggling on both ends of the floor down the stretch. They’re essentially tied with the Bucks for last in clutch offense (96.9 points scored per 100 possessions), with both turnovers and missed shots (on good looks) plaguing them last week. Tyler Herro is now 27-for-95 (28%) on clutch shots, what would be the worst mark in the last 10 seasons for a player with at least 75 attempts.


The Heat’s loss to the Bulls on Saturday was also their sixth (they’re 20-6) in games that they led by double-digits in the 4th quarter. That’s tied for the third most for any team in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data, with the most being eight (2013-14 Pistons). They’ve scored just 94.4 points per 100 possessions in the fourth quarter over their last 21 games.


The Heat got Andrew Wiggins and Kel’el Ware back from five and three-game absences, respectively, on Saturday. Their starting lineup (with Wiggins, Ware and Davion Mitchell) had its best outing (plus-9 in 13.7 minutes) and overall, they’ve been better on both ends of the floor in 318 minutes with Bam Adebayo on the floor together (plus-3.5 per 100 possessions) than they’ve been with Adebayo on the floor without the rookie (minus-2.1 per 100).

The Heat’s schedule remains home-heavy for the next 2 1/2 weeks, but after hosting the Hornets on Monday, they’ll play six straight games against teams with winning records. They’re just 1-11 against that group since mid-January.

The Spurs got a win over Brooklyn on Tuesday, but weren’t very competitive in Sacramento or Minnesota over the weekend.
Three takeaways

Playing without Victor Wembanyama, the Spurs rank 28th defensively (121.9 points allowed per 100 possessions) since the All-Star break, having seen the league’s biggest jump in points allowed per 100 possessions from before the break (114.1, 19th). There have been 21 games this season where a team scored at least 30 second-chance points, and two of the 21 came against the Spurs in the last three days.


Stephon Castle continues to come off the bench, but has been the Spurs’ leading scorer (23.3 points per game) over the last six games. He’s seen big jumps in the percentage of his shots that have come in the paint (61% vs. 53% prior) and his field goal percentage in the paint (64.6% vs. 52.5%).


The Spurs have suddenly have an opportunity to capture the final SoFi Play-In Tournament spot in the West. They trail the 10th-place Mavs by three games in the loss column and Dallas is depleted and reeling. Plus, the teams will play two games in San Antonio this week. The other two games on the Spurs’ homestand are against the Hornets and Pelicans.

Of course, the Spurs trail Dallas by six games in the win column and have a jam-packed schedule going forward. Their loss in Minnesota on Sunday began their second stretch of five games in seven days.

The Mavs were already in a (somewhat self-inflicted) rough spot … and then Kyrie Irving tore his ACL last Monday.
Three takeaways

We probably can’t expect a full-strength Irving until the 2026-27 season. He’ll be a free agent the summer before that and will turn 35 years old in March of 2027. Twelve days before that, Anthony Davis (who’s now missed the last 12 games) will turn 34. The duo played 25.2 minutes together before Davis’ injury in his Mavs debut last month.


The Mavs appear heading back to the Lottery, having lost five straight games. Their biggest issues continue to be on the defensive end of the floor, where they’ve allowed 126.3 points per 100 possessions over the losing streak. Their only available big man (Dwight Powell) played just 14 total minutes over their two weekend losses, when they allowed the Grizzlies and Suns to total 142 points in the paint.


One bright spot has been two-way player Brandon Williams, who’s totaled 19 assists and six steals over the last three games while scoring a career-high 31 points against Memphis on Friday. But Williams left the Mavs’ loss to Phoenix with a hamstring issue.

Given their continued attrition, the Mavs may need to sign an extra player or two before they play the second game of their Sunday-Monday back-to-back in San Antonio. That’s the start of a stretch where they’re playing eight of 10 on the road.

The Bulls have won two straight games for the first time in 2025, strengthening their status as a SoFi Play-In  Tournament team by beating two of the others — Orlando and Miami — on the road.
Two takeaways

The Bulls trailed both games after 36 minutes, but outscored the Magic and Heat by 23 points (despite shooting just 6-for-24 from 3-point range) over the two fourth quarters. They haven’t been particularly good (outscored by 3.9 points per 100 possessions) in fourth quarters overall, but lead the league with 11 wins (they’re 11-32) when trailing after the third.


Fifty of the Bulls’ 65 fourth-quarter points over the last two games have come from Coby White (27) and Tre Jones, who has started the last three games in place of Lonzo Ball. White had the go-ahead baskets on tough drives both nights, Josh Giddey hit the dagger 3 from 26 feet (capping a 26-point triple-double) on Saturday, and the Bulls have scored 53 points on 39 clutch possessions (1.36 per) as they’ve won their last three games that were within five points in the last five minutes.

Only eight of the Bulls’ 18 remaining games are against teams currently with winning records, but their visit to Houston on Saturday is the start of their longest road trip of the season (six games over 10 days) and a stretch of nine straight games against the Western Conference.

After sweeping a two-game series in Orlando, the Raptors went 1-1 to start a stretch of five straight games within the bottom seven teams in the league.
Two takeaways

The Raptors sat their starters down the stretch in Orlando on Tuesday and allowed the Magic’s 28th-ranked offense to score 16 points on nine clutch possessions, but still won when Ja’Kobe Walter drained a somewhat awkward 3-pointer with 0.5 seconds left. More impressive was that they successfully executed a creative “elevator doors” play for an A.J. Lawson 3 for the lead two possessions earlier. Elevator doors plays are always fun, but tough to pull off, because the shooter is always traveling directly away from the basket when he passes through the doors.


The Raptors’ offense continues to be anemic (102.5 points scored per 100 possessions) in their limited minutes with Immanuel Quickley, RJ Barrett and Scottie Barnes on the floor together. But the defensive numbers have been better in their minutes since the All-Star break (111.5 points allowed per 100 possessions) than they were before (124.4 allowed per 100), with a huge drop in opponent 3-point percentage (from 42.6% to 31.0%) being the key factor.

The Raptors’ four-game homestand will conclude with a second straight game against Washington and a visit from the Sixers. Toronto still has the best record (7-3) in games played between the bottom seven teams in the league, with nine games remaining within that group.

After a 5-2 stretch, the Pelicans got back to playing good teams and have dropped four straight games .
Two takeaways

The Pelicans have been starting a big lineup, with Trey Murphy III and Zion Williamson on the wings and Kelly Olynyk and Yves Missi up front. Size usually helps on defense, but the lineup has allowed an amazing 129.2 points per 100 possessions in its 78 minutes. That includes 36 points on 22 defensive possessions (1.64 per) in their loss in Houston on Saturday, what was both the Rockets’ best offensive game and the Pels’ worst defensive game of the season. It was also the 10th game in which the Pelicans never held a lead, with that total leading the league.


With that, the Pelicans now rank last defensively. They’ve allowed 6.6 more points per 100 possessions than they did last season (111.9, sixth), a jump more than double that of any other team. (The Sixers’ jump of 3.1 per 100 is the second biggest.)

A 7-2 stretch had put the Nets in contention for the last SoFi Play-In Tournament spot in the East, but they’ve since dropped seven straight games, with losses at Washington and Charlotte (in which they had rest advantages) included.
Two takeaways

The Nets led by 22 early against the Warriors and by 14 late in Charlotte, but now have 12 losses (they’re 16-12) in games they’ve led by double-digits, tying their total from last season (28-12). They now rank as the league’s worst fourth-quarter team, having been outscored by an incredible 34.6 points per 100 possessions (scoring just 90.9 per 100) in the fourth quarter over the seven-game losing streak.


Cam Thomas has played in four of the Nets’ last five games but has shot just 7-for-31 (23%) from 3-point range since his return. He did have 13 assists (and just two turnovers) over the Nets losses to the Spurs and Warriors last week and, as you might expect, the offense has been pretty efficient on both ends of the floor (121 combined points per 100 possessions) in the 70 minutes that Thomas and D’Angelo Russell have played together.

Tyrese Maxey was dealing with a finger injury that had clearly affected his shot; Among 126 players with at least 200 field goal attempts before the All-Star break and at least 75 attempts since, he’s seen the second-biggest drop in effective field goal percentage (from 52.4% to 38.2%). Then, he suffered a back contusion against Portland and has missed the last two games. Before the win over Utah on Sunday, the Sixers had lost their last eight games without their point guard.


Three reserves played more minutes than all five of the Sixers’ starters on Sunday. One of the three was center Adam Bona, who finished with 14 points, 15 rebounds, two steals and five blocks in less than 32 minutes. Philly had been getting clobbered on the glass and had grabbed just 43% of available rebounds with Andre Drummond on the floor over the three-game losing streak that preceded the game on Sunday. Drummond still leads the league in individual rebounding percentage, but his rate of 21.0% would be his lowest in the last 11 seasons.

The Sixers are 10-10 in games played between the nine East teams with losing records, with 10 games left within the group. The first two of those are in Atlanta and Toronto this week, and they’ll be at a rest disadvantage for what is their first of three meetings with the Hawks.

The Wizards have won four of their last six games and now trail both Charlotte and Utah by just two in the win column.
Two takeaways

The four wins have come against the Nets, Hornets, Jazz and Raptors. The Wizards are now 8-4 (second best) in games played between the bottom seven teams in the league. They’re 6-0 within the group since Feb. 1, having scored 118.3 points per 100 possessions over those six games. A lot of Wizards (and former Wizards) have contributed to that success, with only five having played in all six games. Bilal Coulibaly has led those five, averaging 17.2 points per game over the six wins.


Through January, the Wizards had been outscored by 15.2 points per game, the worst point differential in NBA history. But they’ve climbed to minus-12.0 (fourth worst) over their 15 games since Feb. 1, having seen improvement on both ends of the floor. Khris Middleton’s numbers (12.3 points and 4.1 assists per game, 45% shooting) aren’t particularly noteworthy, but since he started playing after the All-Star break, the Wizards have been 23.3 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (plus-9.5) than with him off the floor (minus-13.8).

The Wizards have six games remaining against the other six teams that have won less than 35% of their games this season. Their win in Toronto on Saturday was the start of their longest road trip of the season (seven games), which includes more meetings with the Raptors and Jazz.

The Hornets put an end to a nine-game losing streak by coming back from 14 points down in the fourth quarter against Brooklyn on Saturday.
Two takeaways

The final score on Saturday was 105-102, but it was the second slowest-paced game of the season (86 possessions for the Hornets, 88 for the Nets) and the Hornets’ most efficient offensive performance in a game in which they didn’t have LaMelo Ball. After scoring just 95.6 points per 100 possessions over their previous 10 games (and looking like they were going to finish last in offensive efficiency), they’ve scored 116.9 per 100 over the last three, almost ending the Cavs’ winning streak on Friday.


Miles Bridges has averaged 31.7 points over the three games, also coming up with the game-saving block on Saturday. His effective field goal percentage (49.9%) and true shooting percentage (54.5%) are still his lowest marks in the last five years, with the latter ranking 39th among 47 players with a usage rate of 25% or higher. Ball (53.6%) ranks 44th.

The Hornets will play 12 of their final 19 games on the road, currently holding the league’s worst road record (5-24). Their last road win was against the Lakers coming out of the All-Star break, and they’ll be back in L.A. (to face the Clippers) at the end of their four-game trip this week.

The Jazz are one of three teams without a win in March. Their five-game losing streak includes four losses to other teams in the bottom seven in the league.
Two takeaways

Losses to the Pistons and Raptors last week were the Jazz’s sixth and seventh games with at least 25 turnovers. That’s the most games with at least 25 turnovers for any team in the last 10 seasons. The Jazz still have the worst turnover differential (by a wide margin) in the 48 seasons for which turnovers have been counted, having committed fewer than their opponent in only seven of their 64 games.


John Collins and Lauri Markkanen have each missed eight of the last nine games, so there’s been playing time available on the frontline for Kyle Filipowski. The rookie averaged 22.5 points (on an effective field goal percentage of 67%) and 8.3 rebounds over the Jazz’s four games last week, with the Jazz outscoring their opponents (by 4.7 points per 100 possessions) in his 111 minutes on the floor. At one point on Wednesday, Marcus Smart was playing back-up center for the Wizards, and Filipowski buried him under the basket.

One team the Jazz have yet to play this season is the Celtics, who they’ll meet twice in the next 12 days. They’ll be at a rest disadvantage as their five-game trip continues in Boston on Monday.

Will Zion Williamson, CJ McCollum and Co. get an early summer vacation as New Orleans attempts to rack up the losses? I think I speak for all of us when I say we can't wait to find out."

Miles Bridges. The athletic, powerful forward is averaging 33 points, nine rebounds and four assists in his last six games on 52/40/89 splits."

Walker Kessler joined some incredibly famous names like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Shaquille O'Neal by putting up a rare line of 18 points, 25 rebounds and eight blocks against the Raptors last week. That's one of the rare highlights, however, as Utah has dropped seven in a row."

Washington is 4-4 this season with Khris Middleton and 9-47 without him ... what a pickup."
